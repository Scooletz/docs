# Replace License
<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

* If you upgrade to RavenDB 6.0, you need to upgrade your current license key 
  before applying it to the new version. Use our online license upgrade tool 
  as explained [below](../../start/licensing/replace-license.mdx#upgrade-a-license-key-for-ravendb-6x)

## Maintain auto-renewal of Let's Encrypt certificates 

* If you set RavenDB up using the [Setup Wizard](../../start/installation/setup-wizard.mdx) 
  and used a Let's Encrypt certificate,  contact [customer support](https://ravendb.net/contact)

  license ID and the ID that Let's Encrypt expects when renewing the certificate.
