* Prior to reading this article, please refer to [full-Text search with dynamic queries](../../client-api/session/querying/text-search/full-text-search.mdx) 
  to learn about the `search` method.  

* **All capabilities** provided by `search` with a dynamic query can also be used when querying a static-index.

* However, as opposed to making a dynamic search query where an auto-index is created for you,  
  when using a **static-index**:  

    * You must configure the index-field in which you want to search.  
      See examples below.  
      
    * You can configure which analyzer will be used to tokenize this field.  
      See [selecting an analyzer](../../indexes/using-analyzers.mdx#selecting-an-analyzer-for-a-field).    
* In this article:
  * [Indexing single field for FTS](../../indexes/querying/searching.mdx#indexing-single-field-for-fts)

## Indexing single field for FTS

#### The index:

<TabItem value="index_1" label="index_1">
<CodeBlock language="php">

class Employees_ByNotes_IndexEntry
\{
    private ?string $employeeNotes = null;

    public function getEmployeeNotes(): ?string
    \{
        return $this->employeeNotes;
    \}

    public function setEmployeeNotes(?string $employeeNotes): void
    \{
        $this->employeeNotes = $employeeNotes;
    \}
\}
class Employees_ByNotes extends AbstractIndexCreationTask
\{
    public function __construct()
    \{
        parent::__construct();

        // The 'Map' function defines the content of the index-fields
        $this->map =

        # Set 'FieldIndexing.Search' on index-field 'employee_notes'
        $this->index("employee_notes", FieldIndexing::search());

        # Optionally: Set your choice of analyzer for the index-field:
        # Here the text from index-field 'EmployeeNotes' will be tokenized by 'WhitespaceAnalyzer'.
        $this->analyze("employee_notes", "WhitespaceAnalyzer");

        # Note:

#### Query with Search:

* Use `search` to make a full-text search when querying the index.  

* Refer to [Full-Text search with dynamic queries](../../client-api/session/querying/text-search/full-text-search.mdx) for all available **Search options**,  
  such as using wildcards, searching for multiple terms, etc.

            "  \{" .
            # Multiple document-fields can be indexed
            # into the single index-field 'employee_data'

#### Sample query:

`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>



## Indexing all fields for FTS (using AsJson)

* To search across ALL fields in a document without defining each one explicitly, use the `AsJson` method,
  which is available in the **C# LINQ string** that is assigned to the `map` property in the PHP index class,
  as shown in the example below.

* This approach makes the index robust to changes in the document schema.  
  By calling `.Select(x => x.Value)` on the result of `AsJson(...)`,
  the index automatically includes values from ALL existing and newly added properties
  and there is no need to update the index when the document structure changes.

* <Admonition type="info" title="">
  This indexing method is supported only when using **Lucene** as the indexing engine.

#### The index:

<TabItem value="index_3" label="index_3">
<CodeBlock language="php">
{`class Products_ByAllValues_IndexEntry
\{
    public ?string $allValues = null;
    public function getAllValues(): ?string

    \}
    public function setAllValues(?string $allValues): void
    \{

            # Use the 'AsJson' method to convert the document into a JSON-like structure
            # and call 'Select' to extract only the values of each property
            "    allValues = this.AsJson(product).Select(x => x.Value) " .
            "\})";

        # Set the search engine type to Lucene:
        $this->setSearchEngineType(SearchEngineType::lucene());
    \}

`}

#### Sample query:

<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`from index "Products/ByAllValues"

`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>



## Boosting search results

* To prioritize results, you can provide a boost value to the searched terms.  
  This can be applied by either of the following:

  * Add a boost value to the relevant index-field **inside the index definition**.  
    Refer to the indexes [Boosting](../../indexes/boosting.mdx) article.  

  * Add a boost value to the queried terms **at query time**.  
    Refer to the [Boost search results](../../client-api/session/querying/text-search/boost-search-results.mdx) article.
