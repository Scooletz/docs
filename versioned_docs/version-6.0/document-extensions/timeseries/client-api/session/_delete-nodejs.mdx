* Use `timeSeriesFor.delete` for the following actions:

    * **Delete a range of entries**
    * **Delete the whole time series**

## `Delete` usage

**Flow**:

* Open a session.  
* Create an instance of `timeSeriesFor` and pass it the following:
    * Provide an explicit document ID, or -   
      pass an [entity tracked by the session](../../../../client-api/session/what-is-a-session-and-how-does-it-work.mdx#unit-of-work-pattern),
      e.g. a document object returned from [session.query](../../../../client-api/session/querying/how-to-query.mdx) or from [session.load](../../../../client-api/session/loading-entities.mdx#load).
    * Specify the time series name.
* Call `TimeSeriesFor.Delete`:
    * Provide a single timestamp to delete a specific entry, or -
    * Specify a range of timestamps to delete multiple entries.
* Call `session.saveChanges` for the action to take effect on the server.  

**Note**:

* If the specified document doesn't exist, a `DocumentDoesNotExistException` is thrown.
* Attempting to delete nonexistent entries results in a no-op and generates no exception.
* To delete the whole time series simply delete all its entries.  
  The series is removed when all its entries are deleted.
* Deleting a document deletes all its time series as well.



## Examples

In the following examples we delete time series entries appended by sample code in the 
[Append](../../../../document-extensions/timeseries/client-api/session/append.mdx) article.  
#### Delete single entry:

<TabItem value="delete_1" label="delete_1">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`// Get an instance of 'timeSeriesFor'
const tsf = session.timeSeriesFor("users/john", "HeartRates");

// Call 'deleteAt' to delete a specific entry
timeStampOfEntry = new Date(baseTime.getTime() + 60_000);
tsf.deleteAt(timeStampOfEntry);

// Save changes
await session.saveChanges();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
#### Delete range of entries:

<TabItem value="delete_2" label="delete_2">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`// Get an instance of 'timeSeriesFor'
const tsf = session.timeSeriesFor("users/john", "HeartRates");

// Delete a range of 5 entries
FromTimeStamp = new Date(baseTime.getTime());
ToTimeStamp = new Date(baseTime.getTime() + 60_000 * 5);
tsf.delete(FromTimeStamp, ToTimeStamp);

// Save changes
await session.saveChanges();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
#### Delete time series:

<TabItem value="delete_3" label="delete_3">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`// Get an instance of 'timeSeriesFor'
const tsf = session.timeSeriesFor("users/john", "HeartRates");

// Delete ALL entries
// The whole time series will be removed
tsf.delete();

// Save changes
await session.saveChanges();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## Syntax

<TabItem value="syntax" label="syntax">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`// Available overloads:
// ====================

delete();          // Delete all entries
deleteAt(at);      // Delete a specific entry
delete(from, to);  // Delete a range of enties
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

| Parameter | Type   | Description                                   |
|-----------|--------|:----------------------------------------------|
| **at**    | `Date` | Timestamp of the time series entry to delete. |
| **from**  | `Date` | Delete the time series entries range that starts at this timestamp (inclusive).<br/>Pass `null` to use the minimum date value. |
| **to**    | `Date` | Delete the time series entries range that ends at this timestamp (inclusive).<br/>Pass `null` to use the maximum date value.   |
