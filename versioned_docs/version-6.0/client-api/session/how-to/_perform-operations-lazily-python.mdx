* **Lazy request**:

    * You can define a lazy request within a session (e.g. a lazy-query or a lazy-load request)  
      and defer its execution until actually needed.

    * The lazy request definition is stored in the session and a `Lazy` instance is returned.  
      The request will be sent to the server and executed only when you access the value of this instance.

* **Multiple lazy requests**:

    * Multiple lazy requests can be defined within the same session.

    * When triggering the deferred execution (whether implicitly or explicitly),  
      ALL pending lazy requests held up by the session will be sent to the server in a single call.  
      This can help reduce the number of remote calls made to the server over the network.

## Operations that can be executed lazily

### Load entities

[load](../../../client-api/session/loading-entities.mdx#load) loads a document entity from 
the database into the session.  
Loading entities can be executed **lazily**.   

<TabItem value="lazy_Load" label="lazy_Load">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`lazy_employee = (
    session
    # Add a call to lazily
    .advanced.lazily.
    # Document will not be loaded from the database here, no server call in made
    load("employees/1-A", Employee)
)

employee = lazy_employee.value  # 'load' operation is executed here
# The employee entity is now loaded & tracked by the session
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
### Load entities with include

[load with include](../../../client-api/session/loading-entities.mdx#load-with-includes) loads 
both the document and the specified related document.  
Loading entities with include can be executed **lazily**.

<Tabs groupId='languageSyntax'>
<TabItem value="Lazy_load_with_include" label="Lazy_load_with_include">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`lazy_product = (
    session
    # Add a call to lazily
    .advanced.lazily
    # Request to include the related Supplier document
    # Documents will Not be loaded from the database here, no server call is made
    .include("SupplierId").load("products/1-A")
)

# 'Load with include' operation will be executed here
# Both documents will be retrieved from the database
product = lazy_product.value
# The product entity is now loaded & tracked by the session

# Access the related document, no additional server call is made
supplier = session.load(product.SupplierId)
# The supplier entity is now also loaded & tracked by the session
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="The_document" label="The_document">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`class Product:
    def __init__(self, Id: str = None, Name: str = None, SupplierId: str = None):
        self.Id = Id
        self.Name = Name
        self.SupplierId = SupplierId  # The related document ID
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
### Load entities starting with

[load_starting_with](../../../client-api/session/loading-entities.mdx#loadstartingwith) loads 
entities whose ID starts with the specified prefix.  
Loading entities with a common prefix can be executed **lazily**.

<TabItem value="lazy_LoadStartingWith" label="lazy_LoadStartingWith">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`lazy_employees = (
    session
    # Add a call to lazily
    .advanced.lazily
    # Request to load entities whose ID starts with 'employees/'
    # Documents will Not be loaded from the database here, no server call is made
    .load_starting_with("employees/")
)

employees = lazy_employees.value  # 'load' operation is executed here
# The employee entities is now also loaded & tracked by the session
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
### Conditional load

[conditional_load](../../../client-api/session/loading-entities.mdx#conditionalload) logic is: 

* If the entity is already loaded to the session:  
  no server call is made, the tracked entity is returned.    
* If the entity is Not already loaded to the session:  
  the document will be loaded from the server only if the change-vector provided to the 
  method is older than the one in the server (i.e. if the document in the server is newer).
* Loading entities conditionally can be executed **lazily**.  

<TabItem value="lazy_ConditionalLoad" label="lazy_ConditionalLoad">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`# Create document and get is change-vector:
change_vector: Optional[str] = None
with store.open_session() as session1:
    employee = Employee()
    session1.store(employee, "employees/1-A")
    session1.save_changes()

    # Get the tracked entity change-vector
    change_vector = session1.advanced.get_change_vector_for(employee)

# Conditionally lazy-load the document
with store.open_session() as session2:
    lazy_employee = (
        session2
        # Add a call to lazily
        .advanced.lazily
        # Document will Not be loaded from the database here, no server call is made
        .conditional_load("employees/1-A", change_vector)
    )

    loaded_item = lazy_employee.value  # 'conditional_load' operation is executed here
    employee = loaded_item.entity

    #  If conditional_load has actually fetched the document from the server (logic described above)
    #  then the employee entity is now loaded & tracked by the session
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
### Run query

A query can be executed **lazily**.  
Learn more about running queries lazily in [lazy queries](../../../client-api/session/querying/how-to-perform-queries-lazily.mdx).

<TabItem value="lazy_Query" label="lazy_Query">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`# Define a lazy query:
lazy_employees = (
    session.query(object_type=Employee).where_equals("FirstName", "John")
    # Add a call to lazily, the query will not be executed here
    .lazily()
)

employees = lazy_employees.value  # query is executed here
# Note: Since query results are not projected,
# then the resulting employee entities will be tracked by the session.
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
### Get revisions

All methods for [getting revisions](../../../document-extensions/revisions/client-api/session/loading.mdx) and their metadata can be executed **lazily**.

<TabItem value="lazy_Revisions" label="lazy_Revisions">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`lazy_revisions = (
    session.
    # Add a call to lazily
    advanced.revisions.lazily
    # Revisions will Not be fetched here, no sever call is made
    .get_for("employees/1-A", Employee)
)

# Usage is the same for the other get revisions methods:
# .get()
# .get_metadata_for()

revisions = lazy_revisions.value  # Getting revisions is executed here
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
### Get compare-exchange value

[get_compare_exchange_value](../../../client-api/session/cluster-transaction/compare-exchange.mdx#get-compare-exchange) 
can be executed **lazily**.

<TabItem value="lazy_CompareExchange" label="lazy_CompareExchange">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`with store.open_session(
    session_options=SessionOptions(transaction_mode=TransactionMode.CLUSTER_WIDE)
) as session:
    # Create compare-exchange value:
    session.advanced.cluster_transaction.create_compare_exchange_value("someKey", "someValue")
    session.save_changes()

    # Get the compare-exchange value lazily:
    lazy_cmp_xchg = (
        session
        # Adda a call to lazily
        .advanced.cluster_transaction.lazily
        # Compare-exchange values will Not be fetched here, no server call is made
        .get_compare_exchange_value("someKey")
    )

    # Usage is the same for the other method:
    # .get_compare_exchange_values()

    cmp_xchg_value = lazy_cmp_xchg.value  # Getting compare-exchange value is executed here
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## Multiple lazy requests 

### Execute all requests - implicitly

Accessing the value of ANY of the lazy instances will trigger
the execution of ALL pending lazy requests held up by the session, 
in a SINGLE server call.  

<TabItem value="lazy_ExecuteAll_Implicit" label="lazy_ExecuteAll_Implicit">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`# Define multiple lazy requests
lazy_user_1 = session.advanced.lazily.load("users/1-A")
lazy_user_2 = session.advanced.lazily.load("users/2-A")

lazy_employees = session.query(object_type=Employee).lazily()
lazy_products = session.query(object_type=Product).search("Name", "Ch*").lazily()

# Accessing the value of ANY of the lazy instances will trigger
# the execution of ALL pending lazy requests held up by the session
# This is done in a SINGLE server call
user1 = lazy_user_1.value

# ALL the other values are now also available
# No additional server calls are made when accessing these values
user2 = lazy_user_2.value
employees = lazy_employees.value
products = lazy_products.value
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
### Execute all requests - explicitly

Explicitly calling `execute_all_pending_lazy_operations` will execute 
ALL pending lazy requests held up by the session, in a SINGLE server call.  

<TabItem value="lazy_ExecuteAll_Explicit" label="lazy_ExecuteAll_Explicit">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`# Define multiple lazy requests
lazy_user_1 = session.advanced.lazily.load("users/1-A")
lazy_user_2 = session.advanced.lazily.load("users/2-A")

lazy_employees = session.query(object_type=Employee).lazily()
lazy_products = session.query(object_type=Product).search("Name", "Ch*").lazily()

# Explicitly call 'execute_all_pending_lazy_operations'
# ALL pending lazy requests held up by the session will be executed in a SINGLE server call
session.advanced.eagerly.execute_all_pending_lazy_operations()

# ALL values are now available
# No additional server calls are made when accessing the values
user1 = lazy_user_1.value
user2 = lazy_user_2.value
employees = lazy_employees.value
products = lazy_products.value
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
