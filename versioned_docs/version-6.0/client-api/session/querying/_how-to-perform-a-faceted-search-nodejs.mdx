* A **Faceted Search** provides an efficient way to explore and navigate through large datasets or search results.  

* To make a faceted search,  
  a static-index must be defined for the fields you want to query and apply facets on.  
  Please refer to article **Query by Facets** under [Indexes &gt; Querying &gt; Faceted search](../../../indexes/querying/faceted-search.mdx).
