# Sharding: Anchoring Documents
<Admonition type="note" title="">

* RavenDB normally selects which bucket to store a document in 
  by a [hash code](../../sharding/overview.mdx#buckets-population) 
  based on the document's ID.  
  **Anchoring a document** to a bucket gives the user more control 
  over the selection of a document's bucket.  
* Users cannot explicitly select a document's bucket by number.  
  They can, however, add the document's ID a **suffix** by which 
  the document's bucket will be selected.  
* Documents whose IDs end with the same suffix, will share 
  a bucket (and therefore a shard).  
  If the suffix is another document's ID, the anchored document 
  will be stored in the same bucket as that other document.  
* Making documents share a bucket is useful when, for example, 
  the documents are related and are expected to often be loaded in the 
  same transaction.

## Overview

To anchor a document, add its ID a suffix: the `$` symbol, 
followed by the ID of the anchor document.  
&lt;`anchored document ID`&gt; + `$` + &lt;`anchor document ID`&gt;  

<Admonition type="note" title="">
To determine which bucket a document will be stored in, RavenDB 
normally [runs a hash algorithm](../../sharding/overview.mdx#buckets-population) 
over the entire document ID and uses the bucket pointed at by the 
resulting hash code.  
Anchored documents are an exception to this behavior, as RavenDB 
runs the hash algorithm only over the ID part following the `$` symbol.  
If this part is the ID of an anchor document, the anchored and anchor 
documents will have the same hash code and be stored in the same bucket.  
</Admonition>

In the example below, the document named `Users/70$Users/4` is placed 
in the same bucket as its anchor, `Users/4`.  

!["Anchored Documents"](./assets/anchored-documents.png)

* Users **cannot** select a document's bucket explicitly by its number, 
  but only by adding a suffix by which the bucket number is calculated.  

* It **is** possible to anchor multiple documents to the same document.  
  E.g., naming three documents `Users/70$Users/4`, `Users/71$Users/4`, 
  and `Users/72$Users/4` will make the database store these documents 
  in the same bucket as `Users/4`.  

* It **is** possible to anchor multiple documents to the same bucket 
  using an arbitrary name that represents no existing document.  
  E.g., `Users/1$foo` and `Users/2$foo` **will** share a bucket.  

<Admonition type="warning" title="">
Please do not anchor too many documents to the same bucket, to prevent 
the creation of an oversized bucket that cannot be split and resharded, 
if needed, to balance the database.  
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="note" title="Notes about document names:" id="notes-about-document-names" href="#notes-about-document-names">

* In a document ID that contains multiple `$` symbols, only the 
  suffix following the last `$` will be used to calculate the bucket number.  

* An anchored document is accessible only by its full name.  
  E.g., `Users/4` and `Users/4$Users/5` are two different documents, 
  where `Users/4$Users/5` is anchored to `Users/5` and `Users/4` is not.

## Examples

### Example 1

Explicitly store a document with another document's name as a suffix, 
to keep both documents in the same bucket.  
In this case, keep an invoice in the same bucket as its order.  

<TabItem value="storeInvoiceInOrderBucketExplicitNaming" label="storeInvoiceInOrderBucketExplicitNaming">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`// The invoice will be stored with the order ID as a suffix
session.Store(invoice, invoice.Id + "$" + order.Id);
session.SaveChanges();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

### Example 2

Define and use a naming convention for invoices.  
Whenever an invoice is stored, the $ symbol and an order ID are automatically added 
to the invoice's ID to assure that invoices and orders are kept in the same bucket.  
<TabItem value="storeInvoiceInOrderBucketNamingConvention" label="storeInvoiceInOrderBucketNamingConvention">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`// Store an invoice document in the same bucket as its order document

// Define a naming convention for invoices
// When an invoice is stored, the $ symbol and an order ID will be added to the invoice ID
var conventions = new DocumentConventions();
conventions.RegisterAsyncIdConvention<Invoice>(async (dbName, r) =>
\{
    var id = await conventions.AsyncDocumentIdGenerator(dbName, r);
    return $"\{id\}$\{r.OrderId\}";
\});

// Deploy the naming convention defined above
using (var store = new DocumentStore()
\{
    Urls = new[] \{ "http://127.0.0.1:8080" \},
    Database = "Products",
    Conventions = conventions
\}.Initialize())
\{
    using (var session = store.OpenSession())
    \{
        var order = new Order();
        session.Store(order);
        
        // The invoice will be stored with the order ID as a suffix
        var invoice = new Invoice \{ OrderId = order.Id \};
        session.Store(invoice);
        
        session.SaveChanges();
    \} 
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
