#Boosting

Another great feature that Lucene engine provides and RavenDB leverages is called `boosting`. This feature gives user the ability to manually tune the relevance level of matching documents when performing a query. 

From the index perspective we can associate with an index entry a boosting factor and the higher value it has, the more relevant term will be. To do this we must use `Boost` extension method from `Raven.Client.Linq.Indexing` namespace.

To illustrate it better, let's jump straight into the example

<TabItem value="boosting_1" label="boosting_1">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`public class User
\{
	public string FirstName \{ get; set; \}

	public string LastName \{ get; set; \}
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

To perform a query that will return users that either `FirstName` or `LastName` is equal to **Bob** and to promote users (move them to the top of the results) that `FirstName` matches the phrase, we must first create an index with boosted entry.

<TabItem value="boosting_2" label="boosting_2">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`public class Users_ByName : AbstractIndexCreationTask<User>
\{
	public Users_ByName()
	\{
		this.Map = users => from user in users
							select new
								\{
									FirstName = user.FirstName.Boost(10),
									LastName = user.LastName
								\};
	\}
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

Next step is to perform a query against that index.

<TabItem value="boosting_3" label="boosting_3">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`session.Query<User, Users_ByName>()
	   .Where(x => x.FirstName == "Bob" || x.LastName == "Bob")
	   .ToList();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

Boosting is also available when using `Search` method. You can read more about it [here](searching#boosting).
