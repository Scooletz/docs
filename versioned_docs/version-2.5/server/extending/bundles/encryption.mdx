# Bundle: Encryption

The encryption bundle introduces data encryption to RavenDB. By default it uses AES-128 encryption algorithm, but this can be easily changed if needed. Encryption is fully transparent for the end-user, it applies to all documents and in default configuration to all indexes as well.

## Configuration

If you want to setup new database with encryption bundle using the Studio, then please refer to [this](../../../studio/bundles/encryption.mdx) page.

Three possible configuration options are:   
* **Raven/Encryption/Algorithm** with [AssemblyQualifiedName](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.type.assemblyqualifiedname.aspx) as a value. Additionally provided type must be a subclass of [SymmetricAlgorithm](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.cryptography.symmetricalgorithm.aspx) from `System.Security.Cryptography` namespace and must not be an abstract class    
* **Raven/Encryption/Key** a key used for encryption purposes with minimum length of 8 characters, base64 encoded    
* **Raven/Encryption/EncryptIndexes** Boolean value indicating if the indexes should be encrypted. Default: true   

### Global configuration

All configuration settings can be setup server-wide by adding them to server configuration file.

### Database configuration

All settings can be overridden per database during the database creation process.

<TabItem value="encryption_1" label="encryption_1">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`store.DatabaseCommands.CreateDatabase(new DatabaseDocument
    \{
        Id = "EncryptedDB",
        // Other configuration options omitted for simplicity
        Settings =
            \{
                // ...
                \{"Raven/ActiveBundles", "Encryption"\},
                \{"Raven/Encryption/Algorithm", "System.Security.Cryptography.DESCryptoServiceProvider, mscorlib, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089"\}
            \},
        SecuredSettings =
             \{
                 // ...
                 \{"Raven/Encryption/Key", "<key_here>"\}
             \}
    \});
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

Above example demonstrates how to create `EncryptedDB` with active encryption and with non-default encryption algorithm.

<Admonition type="note" title="">
All encryption settings can only be provided when database is being created. Changing them later will cause DB malfunction.

## Encryption key management

In RavenDB, we have two types of configurations. Server-wide, which is usually located at the `App.config` file and database specific, which is located at the System database. For the `App.config` file, we provide support for encrypting the file using [DPAPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_API), using the standard .NET config file encryption system. For database specific values, we provide our own support for encrypting the values using DPAPI.

So, as the end result of above:    
*	Your documents and indexes are encrypted when they are on disk using strong encryption.    
*	You can use a server wide or database specific key for the encryption.   
*	Your encryption key is guarded using DPAPI.   
*	The data is safely encrypted on disk, and the OS guarantee that no one can access the encryption key.   

<Admonition type="note" title="">
It is your responsibility to backup the encryption key, because there is no way to recover data without it.
