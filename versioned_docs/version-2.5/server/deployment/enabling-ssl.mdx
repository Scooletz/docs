# Enabling SSL

+SSL can only be enabled when RavenDB is running as a Windows Service.
+The certificate has to be installed in the local certificate repository [Certificates - Local Computer\Personal\Certificates] and include the private key (.pfx file), otherwise the following will not work. /}

By default, secure connectivity is disabled. 

To enable the SSL in RavenDB, you need to do the following:

1. change `Raven/UseSsl` configuration to `true`.  
2. tell RavenDB to use the specified X509 certificate. 

To tell RavenDB to use the specified X509 certificate execute the following command on the command line:   
&lt;code&gt;Raven.Server.exe /installSSL=PathToCertificate==CertificatePassword&lt;/code&gt;    
E.g.   
&lt;code&gt;Raven.Server.exe /installSSL=C:\Temp\MyCertificate.pfx==MyPassword&lt;/code&gt;  

To uninstall the certificate execute:    
&lt;code&gt;Raven.Server.exe /uninstallSSL=PathToCertificate==CertificatePassword&lt;/code&gt;

The Studio might not work in some browsers (e.g. Firefox and Chrome) if the domain that certificate was issued for does not match the domain you are using it for.
