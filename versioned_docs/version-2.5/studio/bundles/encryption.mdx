# Bundle: Encryption

When creating a database, if you want to use the encryption bundle you need to select it in the database creation window:  
![Tasks Fig 1](./assets/studio_encryption_1.PNG)  

After pressing "Next" you will get the following page:  
![Tasks Fig 2](./assets/studio_encryption_2.PNG)  

In here an auto-generated key is suggested to you, if you wish to enter a key for your own you can change it.  
Make sure you backup this key!  

In Addition you can set the encryption algorithm:

You can also choose if you want to encrypt the indexes as well (selected by default)

After you create the database, a window with the selected key will appear, this is your last chance to backup the key:
