* `Defer` allows you to register server commands via the session.

* All the deferred requests will be stored in the session and sent to the server in a single batch when saveChanges is called,
  along with any other changes/operations made on the session.  
  Thus, all deferred commands are __executed as part of the session's saveChanges transaction__.

## Defer commands example

<TabItem value="defer_1" label="defer_1">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`const session = documentStore.openSession();

// Define a patchRequest object for the PatchCommandData used in the 'defer' below
const patchRequest = new PatchRequest();
patchRequest.script = "this.Supplier = 'suppliers/2-A';";

// 'defer' is available in the session's advanced methods 
session.advanced.defer(

    // Define commands to be executed:
    // i.e. Put a new document
    new PutCommandDataBase("products/999-A", null, null, \{
        "Name": "My Product",
        "Supplier": "suppliers/1-A"
        "@metadata": \{ "@collection": "Products" \}
    \}),
    
    // Patch document
    new PatchCommandData("products/999-A", null, patchRequest, null),

    // Force a revision to be created
    new ForceRevisionCommandData("products/999-A"),

    // Delete a document
    new DeleteCommandData("products/1-A", null)
);

// All deferred commands will be sent to the server upon calling SaveChanges
await session.saveChanges();

\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
