* Given a string term, the Suggestion feature will offer **similar terms** from your data.

* Word similarities are found using string distance algorithms.

* Examples in this article demonstrate getting suggestions with a **dynamic-query**.  
  For getting suggestions with an **index-query** see [query for suggestions with index](../../../indexes/querying/suggestions.mdx).
* In this page:

## What are terms

* All queries in RavenDB use an index - learn more about that [here](../../../client-api/session/querying/how-to-query.mdx#queries-always-provide-results-using-an-index).  
  Whether making a dynamic query which generates an auto-index or using a static index,  
  the data from your documents is 'broken' into **terms** that are kept in the index.  

* This tokenization process (what terms will be generated) depends on the analyzer used,    
  various analyzers differ in the way they split the text stream. Learn more in [Analyzers](../../../indexes/using-analyzers.mdx).

* The terms can then be queried to retrieve matching documents that contain them.



## When to use suggestions

Querying for suggestions is useful in the following scenarios:

  * **When query has no results**:

      * When searching for documents that match some condition on a given string term,  
        if the term is misspelled then you will Not get any results.  
        You can then ask RavenDB to suggest similar terms that do exist in the index.

      * The suggested terms can then be used in a new query to retrieve matching documents,  
        or simply presented to the user asking what they meant to query.

  * **When looking for alternative terms**:

      * When simply searching for additional alternative terms for a term that does exist.  

<Admonition type="warning" title="">

The resulting suggested terms will Not include the term for which you search,  
they will only contain the similar terms.

## Suggest terms - for single term

Consider this example:  
Based on the Northwind sample data, the following query has no resulting documents,  
as no document in the Products collection contains the term `chaig` in its `Name` field.

<TabItem value="suggest_1" label="suggest_1">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`# This dynamic query on the 'Products' collection has NO documents
products = list(session.query(object_type=Product).where_equals("name", "chaig"))
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

* Executing the above query will generate the auto-index `Auto/Products/ByName`.  
  This auto-index will contain a list of all available terms from the document field `Name`.  
  The generated terms are visible in the Studio - see image [below](../../../client-api/session/querying/how-to-work-with-suggestions.mdx#the-auto-index-terms-in-studio).

* If you suspect that the term `chaig` in the query criteria is written incorrectly,   
  you can ask RavenDB to suggest **existing terms** that are similar to `chaig`, as follows:.

## The auto-index terms in Studio

Based on the Northwind sample data, these are the terms generated for index `Auto/Products/ByName`:

![Figure 1. Auto-index terms](./assets/auto-index-terms.png)

1. **The field name** - derived from the document field that was used in the dynamic-query.  
   In this example the field name is `Name`.

2. **The terms** generated from the data that the Products collection documents have in their `Name` field.
