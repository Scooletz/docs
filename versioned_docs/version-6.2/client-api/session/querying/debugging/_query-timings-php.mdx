* When making a query,   
  you can request to get detailed stats of the time spent by RavenDB on each part of the query.  
  E.g. duration of search, loading documents, transforming results, total duration, etc.

* By default, the timings stats are Not included in the query results, to avoid the measuring overhead.

* **To include the query timings** in the query results:  
  add a call to the `timings()` method in your query code, or add `include timings()` to an RQL query.  
  See examples below.

## Include timings in a query

<Tabs groupId='languageSyntax'>
<TabItem value="query" label="query">
<CodeBlock language="php">
{`$timings = new QueryTimings();

/** @var array<Product> $resultsWithTimings */
$resultsWithTimings = $session->advanced()->documentQuery(Product::class)
    ->timings($timings)
    ->search("Name", "Syrup")
    ->toList();

/** @var array<QueryTimings> $timingsMap */
$timingsMap = $timings->getTimings();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="RQL" label="RQL">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`from "Products"
where search(Name, "Syrup") or search(Name, "Lager")
include timings()
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>



## View timings

* The detailed timings can be viewed from Studio's [Query view](../../../../studio/database/queries/query-view.mdx).

* Running an RQL query with `include timings()` will show an additional **Timings Tab**  
  with a graphical representation of the time spent in each query part.

## Syntax

<TabItem value="syntax" label="syntax">
<CodeBlock language="php">
{`function timings(QueryTimings &$timings): DocumentQueryInterface;
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

| Parameter   | Type           | Description   |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| **&$timings** | `QueryTimings` | A callback function (action) that takes `QueryTimings` as an argument. It will be called by the client with the resulting `QueryTimings`. You can interact with the resulting `QueryTimings` inside your callback. |



## Timings in a sharded database

* In a sharded database, timings for each part are provided **per shard**.

* Learn more in [timings in a sharded database](../../../../sharding/querying.mdx#timing-queries).
