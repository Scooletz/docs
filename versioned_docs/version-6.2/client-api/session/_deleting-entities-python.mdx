Entities can be marked for deletion by using the `delete()` method, but will not be removed from the server until `save_changes()` is called.  

## Syntax

<TabItem value="deleting_1" label="deleting_1">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`def delete(self, key_or_entity: Union[str, object], expected_change_vector: Optional[str] = None) -> None:
    ...
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

| Parameters | | |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| **key_or_entity** | `str` or `object` | ID of the document or instance of the entity to delete |
| **expected_change_vector** | `str` | a change vector to use for concurrency checks |

## Example I

<TabItem value="deleting_2" label="deleting_2">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`employee = session.load("employees/1")

session.delete(employee)
session.save_changes()
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

<Admonition type="note" title="Concurrency on Delete" id="concurrency-on-delete" href="#concurrency-on-delete">
If use_optimistic_concurrency is set to 'True' (default 'False'), the delete() method will use loaded 'employees/1' change vector for concurrency check and might throw ConcurrencyException.  
</Admonition>

## Example II

<TabItem value="deleting_3" label="deleting_3">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`session.delete("employees/1")
session.save_changes()
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

<Admonition type="note" title="Concurrency on Delete" id="concurrency-on-delete" href="#concurrency-on-delete">
The delete() method will not do any change vector based concurrency checks because the change vector for 'employees/1' is unknown.  
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info" title="Information" id="information" href="#information">

If entity is **not** tracked by session, then executing:  

<TabItem value="deleting_4" label="deleting_4">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`session.delete("employees/1")
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

is equal to doing:  

<TabItem value="deleting_5" label="deleting_5">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`session.advanced.defer(DeleteCommandData("employees/1", change_vector=None))
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

<Admonition type="note" title="Change Vector in DeleteCommandData" id="change-vector-in-deletecommanddata" href="#change-vector-in-deletecommanddata">
In this sample the change vector is None - this means that there will be no concurrency checks. A not-None and valid change vector value will trigger a concurrency check.
