* Compare Exchange items are **key/value pairs** where the key is unique across your database. 

* Compare-exchange operations require cluster consensus to ensure consistency across all nodes.  
  Once a consensus is reached, the compare-exchange items are distributed through the Raft algorithm to all nodes in the database group.

* Compare-exchange items can be used to coordinate work between sessions that are trying to modify a shared resource (such as a document) at the same time.

* Compare-exchange items are [not replicated externally](../../../client-api/operations/compare-exchange/overview.mdx#why-compare-exchange-items-are-not-replicated-to-external-databases) to other databases.

## What Compare Exchange Items Are

Compare Exchange items are key/value pairs where the key servers a unique value across your database.

* Each compare-exchange item contains: 
  * **A key** - A unique string identifier in the database scope.
  * **A value** - Can be any object (a number, string, array, or any valid JSON object). 
  * **Metadata** - Data that is associated with the compare-exchange item.
    Must be a valid JSON object.
     * For example, the metadata can be used to set expiration time for the compare-exchange item.  
       Learn more in [compare-exchange expiration](../../../client-api/operations/compare-exchange/compare-exchange-expiration.mdx).  
  * **Raft index** - The compare-exchange item's version.  
    Any change to the value or metadata will increase this number.  

* Creating and modifying a compare-exchange item is an atomic, thread-safe [compare-and-swap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap) interlocked 
  compare-exchange operation.



## Creating and Managing Compare-Exchange Items
  
Compare exchange items are created and managed with any of the following approaches:

* **Document Store Operations**  
  You can manage a compare-exchange item as an [Operation on the document store](../../../client-api/operations/compare-exchange/put-compare-exchange-value.mdx).  
  This can be done within or outside of a session (cluster-wide or single-node session).
   * When inside a session:  
     If the session fails, the compare-exchange operation can still succeed
     because store Operations do not rely on the success of the session.  
     You will need to delete the compare-exchange item explicitly upon session failure if you don't want the compare-exchange item to persist.

* **Cluster-Wide Sessions**  
  You can manage a compare-exchange item from inside a [Cluster-Wide session](../../../client-api/session/cluster-transaction/compare-exchange.mdx).  
  If the session fails, the compare-exchange item creation also fails.  
  None of the nodes in the group will have the new compare-exchange item.


* **Atomic Guards**  
  When creating documents using a cluster-wide session RavenDB automatically creates [Atomic Guards](../../../client-api/session/cluster-transaction/atomic-guards.mdx),  
  which are compare-exchange items that guarantee ACID transactions.  
  See [Cluster-wide vs. Single-node](../../../client-api/session/cluster-transaction/overview.mdx#cluster-wide-transaction-vs-single-node-transaction) for a session comparision overview.

* **Studio**  
  Compare-exchange items can be created from the [Studio](../../../studio/database/documents/compare-exchange-view.mdx#the-compare-exchange-view) as well.



## Why Compare-Exchange Items are Not Replicated to External Databases 

* Each cluster defines its policies and configurations, and should ideally have sole responsibility for managing its own documents. 
  Read [Consistency in a Globally Distributed System](https://ayende.com/blog/196769-B/data-ownership-in-a-distributed-system) 
  to learn more about why global database modeling is more efficient this way.
   
* When creating a compare-exchange item a Raft consensus is required from the nodes in the database group.
  Externally replicating such data is problematic as the target database may reside within a cluster that is in an
  unstable state where Raft decisions cannot be made. In such a state, the compare-exchange item will not be persisted in the target database.

* Conflicts between documents that occur between two databases are solved with the help of the documents
  Change-Vector. Compare-exchange conflicts cannot be handled properly as they do not have a similar
  mechanism to resolve conflicts.

* To ensure unique values between two databases without using compare-exchange items see [Example III](../../../client-api/operations/compare-exchange/overview.mdx#example-iii---ensuring-unique-values-without-using-compare-exchange).



## Example I - Email Address Reservation  

The following example shows how to use compare-exchange to create documents with unique values.  
The scope is within the database group on a single cluster. 

Compare-exchange items are not externally replicated to other databases.  
To establish uniqueness without using compare-exchange see [Example III](../../../client-api/operations/compare-exchange/overview.mdx#example-iii---ensuring-unique-values-without-using-compare-exchange).

<TabItem value="email" label="email">
<CodeBlock language="php">
{`$email = "user@example.com";

$user = new User();
$user->setEmail($email);

$session = $store->openSession();
try \{
    $session->store($user);

    // At this point, the user document has an Id assigned

    // Try to reserve a new user email
    // Note: This operation takes place outside of the session transaction,
    //       It is a cluster-wide reservation

    /** @var CompareExchangeResult $cmpXchgResult */
    $cmpXchgResult = $store->operations()->send(new PutCompareExchangeValueOperation("emails/" . $email, $user->getId(), 0));

    if (!$cmpXchgResult->isSuccessful()) \{
        throw new RuntimeException("Email is already in use");
    \}

    // At this point we managed to reserve/save the user email -
    // The document can be saved in SaveChanges
    $session->saveChanges();
\} finally \{
    $session->close();
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>  

**Implications**:

* The `User` object is saved as a document, hence it can be indexed, queried, etc.  

* This compare-exchange item was [created as an operation](../../../client-api/operations/compare-exchange/put-compare-exchange-value.mdx)
  rather than with a [cluster-wide session](../../../client-api/session/cluster-transaction/overview.mdx).  
  Thus, if `session.saveChanges` fails, then the email reservation is _not_ rolled back automatically.  
  It is your responsibility to do so.  

* The compare-exchange value that was saved can be accessed in a query using `CmpXchg`:  
<Tabs groupId='languageSyntax'>
<TabItem value="query" label="query">
<CodeBlock language="php">
{`$query = $session->advanced()->rawQuery(User::class,
    "from Users as s where id() == cmpxchg(\\"emails/ayende@ayende.com\\")")
    ->toList();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>  
<TabItem value="documentQuery" label="documentQuery">
<CodeBlock language="php">
{`$q = $session->advanced()
    ->documentQuery(User::class)
    ->whereEquals("id", CmpXchg::value("emails/ayende@ayende.com"));
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>  
<TabItem value="RQL" label="RQL">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`from Users as s where id() == cmpxchg("emails/ayende@ayende.com")
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
    </Tabs>
    

## Example II - Reserve a Shared Resource  

In the following example, we use compare-exchange to reserve a shared resource.  
The scope is within the database group on a single cluster.

The code also checks for clients which never release resources (i.e. due to failure) by using timeout.  

<TabItem value="shared_resource" label="shared_resource">
<CodeBlock language="php">
{`class SharedResource
\{
    private ?DateTime $reservedUntil = null;

    public function getReservedUntil(): ?DateTime
    \{
        return $this->reservedUntil;
    \}

    public function setReservedUntil(?DateTime $reservedUntil): void
    \{
        $this->reservedUntil = $reservedUntil;
    \}
\}

class CompareExchangeSharedResource
\{
    private ?DocumentStore $store = null;

    public function printWork(): void
    \{
        // Try to get hold of the printer resource
        $reservationIndex = $this->lockResource($this->store, "Printer/First-Floor", Duration::ofMinutes(20));

        try \{
            // Do some work for the duration that was set.
            // Don't exceed the duration, otherwise resource is available for someone else.
        \} finally \{
            $this->releaseResource($this->store, "Printer/First-Floor", $reservationIndex);
        \}
    \}

    /**  throws InterruptedException */
    public function lockResource(DocumentStoreInterface $store, ?string $resourceName, Duration $duration): int
    \{
        while (true) \{
            $now = new DateTime();

            $resource = new SharedResource();
            $resource->setReservedUntil($now->add($duration->toDateInterval()));

            /** @var CompareExchangeResult<SharedResource> $saveResult */
            $saveResult = $store->operations()->send(
                new PutCompareExchangeValueOperation($resourceName, $resource, 0));

            if ($saveResult->isSuccessful()) \{
                // resourceName wasn't present - we managed to reserve
                return $saveResult->getIndex();
            \}

            // At this point, Put operation failed - someone else owns the lock or lock time expired
            if ($saveResult->getValue()->getReservedUntil() < $now) \{
                // Time expired - Update the existing key with the new value
                /** @var CompareExchangeResult<SharedResource> takeLockWithTimeoutResult */
                $takeLockWithTimeoutResult = $store->operations()->send(
                    new PutCompareExchangeValueOperation($resourceName, $resource, $saveResult->getIndex()));

                if ($takeLockWithTimeoutResult->isSuccessful()) \{
                    return $takeLockWithTimeoutResult->getIndex();
                \}
            \}

            // Wait a little bit and retry
            usleep(20000);
        \}
    \}

    public function releaseResource(DocumentStoreInterface $store, ?string $resourceName, int $index): void
    \{
        $deleteResult = $store->operations()->send(
            new DeleteCompareExchangeValueOperation(SharedResource::class, $resourceName, $index)
        );

        // We have 2 options here:
        // $deleteResult->isSuccessful is true - we managed to release resource
        // $deleteResult->isSuccessful is false - someone else took the lock due to timeout
    \}
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## Example III - Ensuring Unique Values without Using Compare Exchange  

Unique values can also be ensured without using compare-exchange.

The below example shows how to achieve that by using **reference documents**.  
The reference documents' IDs will contain the unique values instead of the compare-exchange items.

Using reference documents is especially useful when [External Replication](../../../server/ongoing-tasks/external-replication.mdx) 
is defined between two databases that need to be synced with unique values.  
The reference documents will replicate to the destination database, 
as opposed to compare-exchange items, which are not externally replicated.

<Admonition type="note" title="">
Sessions which process fields that must be unique should be set to [TransactionMode::clusterWide()](../../../client-api/session/cluster-transaction/overview.mdx).

<TabItem value="create_uniqueness_control_documents" label="create_uniqueness_control_documents">
<CodeBlock language="php">
{`// When you create documents that must contain a unique value such as a phone or email, etc.,
// you can create reference documents that will have that unique value in their IDs.
// To know if a value already exists, all you need to do is check whether a reference document with such ID exists.
