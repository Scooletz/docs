Authentication and authorization is based on [client X.509 certificates](../server/security/authorization/security-clearance-and-permissions.mdx).

The authentication options argument in `DocumentStore` constructor property allows you to pass a certificate which will be used by the RavenDB client to connect to a server. 

<Admonition type="note" title="">
If your RavenDB server instance is served using `https`, then your application is required to use a client certificate in order to be able to access the server. You can find more information [here](../server/security/overview.mdx).

## Example

<TabItem value="client_cert" label="client_cert">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`import \{ DocumentStore \} from "ravendb";
import * as fs from "fs";

// load certificate and prepare authentication options
const authOptions = \{
    certificate: fs.readFileSync("C:\\\\ravendb\\\\client-cert.pfx"),
    type: "pfx", // or "pem"
    password: "my passphrase"
\};

const store = new DocumentStore([ "https://my_secured_raven" ], "Northwind", authOptions);
store.initialize();

// proceed with your work here
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
