# Cluster: Cluster Node Health Check

A health check sends an HTTP request to the `/databases/[Database Name]/stats` endpoint. 
If the request is successful, it will reset node failure counters which will cause the client to try sending operations to that specific node again.

### When Does it Trigger?

Any time a low-level [operation](../operations/what-are-operations.mdx) fails to connect to a node, the client spawns a health check thread for that particular node. 
The thread will periodically ping the not responding server until it gets a proper response.
The frequency of pinging the non-responsive server will start from 100ms and will gradually increase until it reaches 5sec intervals.
