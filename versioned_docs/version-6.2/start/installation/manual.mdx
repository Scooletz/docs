# Installation: Manual Setup

<Admonition type="note" title="Automatic Certificate Renewals Via Setup Wizard" id="automatic-certificate-renewals-via-setup-wizard" href="#automatic-certificate-renewals-via-setup-wizard">

RavenDB has developed a quick and simple process to set up a fully secure cluster with our Setup Wizard.  
We've developed automatic renewals of certificates when setting up with the Setup Wizard together with Let's Encrypt.  

If you choose manual setup and/or to provide your own certificate, **you are responsible for its periodic renewal**.

## Downloading Server and Setting Up Node Folders
Download the [RavenDB server package](https://ravendb.net/download) and extract it into permanent server folders on each machine.  

We recommend using multiple machines to improve [cluster availability via failover](../../client-api/cluster/how-client-integrates-with-replication-and-cluster.mdx) in case one goes down.  

* Each folder that contains an extracted server package will become a functional node in your cluster.  
* If you move the folders after installation, **the server will not work**.  
   You'll receive a 'System.InvalidOperationException: Unable to start the server.' error because it will look for the file path that is set when you install.  

By default, when a server is started using `run.ps1` (or `run.sh` in Linux) script. It will open a browser with a [Setup Wizard](../../start/installation/setup-wizard.mdx) which will guide you through the server configuration process.  

The setup is started because the default configuration file [settings.json](../../server/configuration/configuration-options.mdx#settingsjson) (found in the downloaded RavenDB Server package inside the **Server** folder) comes configured like this:

<TabItem value="json" label="json">
<CodeBlock language="json">
{`\{
    "ServerUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:0",
    "Setup.Mode": "Initial",
    "DataDir": "RavenData"
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

Which means that the Server will run:

- On `localhost` with a `random port`
- In `Setup Wizard` mode
- Store the data in `RavenData` directory

## Disabling 'Setup Wizard'

To disable the 'Setup Wizard' please change the `Setup.Mode` in the settings.json configuration to `None` or remove it completely.

## Server Url and Port

Setting the `ServerUrl` to `http://127.0.0.1:0` will bind the server to a `localhost` with a `random port`. For manual setup we suggest changing the port to a non-random value - e.g. **8080**.

<Admonition type="note" title="Port in Use" id="port-in-use" href="#port-in-use">

In some cases the port might be in use, this will prevent the Server from starting with "address in use" error (`EADDRINUSE`).  
For a list of IPs and ports already in use on your machine, enter `netstat -a` in the command line.

## Security

<Admonition type="warning" title="Protect Your Cluster From The Start" id="protect-your-cluster-from-the-start" href="#protect-your-cluster-from-the-start">

We highly recommend securing your server from the start to [prevent potential vulnerabilities](https://ravendb.net/articles/ravendb-secure-by-default-document-database) later.  
 RavenDB makes securing your cluster from the start as easy as possible to prevent the possiblity of forgetting to secure before going into production. 

If you set RavenDB to listen to connections outside your local machine without first securing your cluster, 
your database will immediately block this now vulnerable configuration and require the administrator to properly setup the security and 
access control to prevent unauthorized access.

Read the [Manual Certificate Configuration](../../server/security/authentication/certificate-configuration.mdx) section to learn how to setup security manually.

## Configuration

Read the [Configuration Section](../../server/configuration/configuration-options.mdx) to learn more about using [settings.json](../../server/configuration/configuration-options.mdx#settingsjson) and see a list of configuration options.
