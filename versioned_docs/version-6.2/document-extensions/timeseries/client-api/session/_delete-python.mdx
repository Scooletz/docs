* Use `time_series_for.delete_at` to delete a time series entry.  
* Use `time_series_for.delete` to delete a range of time series entries.  
* A time series is removed when all of its entries are deleted.  

* In this page:  
    * [usage](../../../../document-extensions/timeseries/client-api/session/delete.mdx#usage)

## usage

**Flow**:

* Open a session.  
* Create an instance of `time_series_for` and pass it the following:
    * Provide an explicit document ID, or -   
      pass an [entity tracked by the session](../../../../client-api/session/what-is-a-session-and-how-does-it-work.mdx#unit-of-work-pattern),
      e.g. a document object returned from [session.query](../../../../client-api/session/querying/how-to-query.mdx) 
      or from [session.load](../../../../client-api/session/loading-entities.mdx#load).
    * Specify the time series name.
* Call `time_series_for.delete_at` and provide the **timestamp** of an entry you want to delete,  
  -or-  
  Call `time_series_for.delete` and provide the **timestamps range** of the entries you want to delete.  
* Call `session.save_changes` for the action to take effect on the server.  

**Note**:

* If the specified document doesn't exist, a `DocumentDoesNotExistException` will be thrown.  
* Attempting to delete nonexistent entries results in a no-op and generates no exception.  
* To delete a whole time series simply delete all its entries.  
  The series is removed when all its entries are deleted.  
* Deleting a document deletes all its time series as well.  



## Example

In the following example we delete a time series entry appended by sample code in the 
[Append](../../../../document-extensions/timeseries/client-api/session/append.mdx) article.  
<TabItem value="timeseries_region_Delete-TimeSeriesFor-Single-Time-Point" label="timeseries_region_Delete-TimeSeriesFor-Single-Time-Point">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`# Delete a single entry
with store.open_session() as session:
    session.time_series_for("users/john", "HeartRates").delete(base_line + timedelta(minutes=1))
    session.save_changes()
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## Syntax

<TabItem value="TimeSeriesFor-Delete-definition-single-timepoint" label="TimeSeriesFor-Delete-definition-single-timepoint">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`def delete_at(self, at: datetime) -> None: ...
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="TimeSeriesFor-Delete-definition-range-of-timepoints" label="TimeSeriesFor-Delete-definition-range-of-timepoints">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`def delete(self, datetime_from: Optional[datetime] = None, datetime_to: Optional[datetime] = None): ...
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

| Parameter | Type        | Description                                |
|-----------|-------------|:-------------------------------------------|
| **at**    | `datetime`  | Timestamp of a time series entry to delete |
| **datetime_from** (Optional) | `datetime` | Delete the time series entries range that starts at this timestamp (inclusive) |
| **datetime_to** (Optional) | `datetime` | Delete the time series entries range that ends at this timestamp (inclusive)     |
