## Expiration feature usages

Use the Expiration feature when data is needed only for a given time period.  
E.g., for -  

 * Shopping cart data that is kept only for a certain time period  
 * Email links that need to be expired after a few hours  
 * A web application login session details  
 * Cache data from an SQL server  



## Configuring the expiration feature

Documents expiration settings can be changed via Studio or the API.  
It is possible to:  

* Enable or Disable the deletion of expired documents.  
  Default value: **Disable** the deletion of expired documents.  
* Determine how often RavenDB would look for expired documents and delete them.  
  Default value: **60 seconds**  
* Set the maximal number of documents that RavenDB is allowed to delete per interval.  
  Default value: **All expired documents**

</Admonition>
### Configure expiration settings using the client API  

Modify the expiration settings using the client API by setting an `ExpirationConfiguration` 
object and sending it to RavenDB using a `ConfigureExpirationOperation` operation.  

#### Example:

<TabItem value="something" label="configuration">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`await store.Maintenance.SendAsync(new ConfigureExpirationOperation(new ExpirationConfiguration
\{
    Disabled = false,
    DeleteFrequencyInSec = 60,
    MaxItemsToProcess = 1000
\}));
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

#### `ExpirationConfiguration`

<TabItem value="something" label="expirationConfiguration">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`public class ExpirationConfiguration
\{
    // Set 'Disabled' to false to enable the deletion of expired items                    
    public bool Disabled \{ get; set; \}

    // How frequently to delete expired items
    public long? DeleteFrequencyInSec \{ get; set; \}

    // How many items to delete (per batch)
    public long? MaxItemsToProcess \{ get; set; \}
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| **Disabled** | `bool` | If `true`, deleting expired documents is disabled for the entire database.&lt;BR&gt;Default: `true` |
| **DeleteFrequencyInSec** | `long?` | Determines how often (in seconds) the expiration feature looks for expired documents and deletes them.&lt;BR&gt;Default: `60` |
| **MaxItemsToProcess** | `long?` | Determines the maximal number of documents the feature is allowed to delete in one run. |



## Setting the document expiration time

* To set a document expiration time, add the document's `@metadata` an 
  `@expires` property with the designated expiration time as a value.  
  Set the time in **UTC** format, not local time. E.g. -  
  **"@expires": "2025-04-22T08:00:00.0000000Z"**  
  <Admonition type="warning" title="Warning">
  Metadata properties starting with `@` are for internal RavenDB usage only.  
  Do _not_ use the metadata `@expires` property for any other purpose than 
  scheduling a document's expiration time for the built-in expiration feature.  
  </Admonition>
* If and when the expiration feature is enabled, it will process all documents 
  carrying the `@expires` flag and automatically delete each document 
  [by its expiration time](../../server/extensions/expiration#eventual-consistency-considerations).  
* To set the document expiration time from the client, use the following code:
<TabItem value="something" label="expiration1">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`DateTime expiry = DateTime.UtcNow.AddMinutes(5);
using (IAsyncDocumentSession session = store.OpenAsyncSession())
\{
    await session.StoreAsync(user);
    session.Advanced.GetMetadataFor(user)[Constants.Documents.Metadata.Expires] = expiry;
    await session.SaveChangesAsync();
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## Eventual consistency considerations

* Internally, RavenDB tracks all documents carrying the `@expires` flag even if the 
  expiration feature is disabled. This way, once the expiration feature is enabled expired 
  documents can be processed without delay.  
* Once a document expires, it may take up to the _delete frequency interval_ (60 seconds by default) 
  until is it actually deleted.  
* Deletion may be further delayed if `MaxItemsToProcess` is set, limiting the number 
  of documents that RavenDB is allowed to delete each time the expiration feature is invoked.  
* Expired documents are _not_ filtered out during `load`, `query`, or indexing, so be aware that 
  as long as an expired document hasn't been actually deleted it may still be included in the results.

## Expiration feature usages

Use the Expiration feature when data is needed only for a given time period.  

Examples:

 * Shopping cart data that is kept only for a certain time period  
 * Email links that need to be expired after a few hours  
 * A web application login session details  
 * Cache data from an SQL server  



## Configuring the expiration feature

* By default, the expiration feature is turned **off**.  
* The deletion frequency is configurable.  
  The default frequency is 60 seconds.  
* The Expiration feature can be turned **on** or **off** using **Studio**,  
  see [Setting Document Expiration in Studio](../../studio/database/settings/document-expiration).  
* The Expiration feature can also be configured using the **Client**:
<TabItem value="something-something" label="expiration_1">
<CodeBlock language="nodejs">
{`// Enable document expiration and set the frequency to 50 seconds:
// ===============================================================

// Define the expiration configuration object 
const expirationConfiguration = \{
    disabled: false,           // Enable expiration
    deleteFrequencyInSec: 50   // Set frequency to 50 seconds
\};

// Define the configure expiration operation,
// pass the configuration to set
const configureExpirationOp = new ConfigureExpirationOperation(expirationConfiguration);

// Execute the operation by passing it to maintenance.send
await store.maintenance.send(configureExpirationOp);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## Setting the document expiration time

* To set document expiration time add an `@expires` property to the document 
  `@metadata` and set the property's value to the designated expiration time.  
  <Admonition type="note" title="Note">
  The date must be in **UTC** format, not local time.  
  </Admonition>
  <Admonition type="warning" title="Warning">
  Metadata properties starting with `@` are internal for RavenDB usage.  
  Do _not_ use metadata `@expires` property for any other usage but that of the built-in expiration feature.  
  </Admonition>
* Once the Expiration feature is enabled, the document will be automatically deleted at the specified time.  
  <Admonition type="info" title="Info">
  Internally, each document that has the `@expires` property in the metadata is tracked 
  by the RavenDB server even if the expiration feature is turned off.  
  This way, once the expiration feature is turned on RavenDB can delete expired documents right away.  
  </Admonition>
* To set the document expiration time from the client, use the following code:
<TabItem value="something-something" label="expiration_2">
<CodeBlock language="nodejs">
{`// Setting a new document to expire after 5 minutes:
// =================================================

// Create a new document
const newEmployee = new Employee();
newEmployee.lastName = "Smith";

const session = documentStore.openSession();
await session.store(newEmployee);

// Get the metadata of the document
const metadata = session.advanced.getMetadataFor(newEmployee);

// Set the '@expires' metadata property with the expiration date in UTC format
const expiresAt = new Date(new Date().getTime() + (5 * 60_000))
metadata[CONSTANTS.Documents.Metadata.EXPIRES] = expiresAt.toISOString();

// Save the new document to the database
await session.saveChanges();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## Eventual consistency considerations

* Once documents expire, it may take up to the _delete frequency interval_ (60 seconds by default) 
  until they are actually deleted.  
* Expired documents are _not_ filtered out during `load`, `query`, or indexing, so be aware that an expired 
  document may still be included in the results after its expiration, for the period set by _delete frequency interval_.
