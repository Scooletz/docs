# Ongoing Tasks: Queue Sink Overview
<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

* Message brokers are high-throughput, distributed messaging services that 
  host data they receive from **producer** applications and serve it to 
  **consumer** clients via FIFO data queues. 
* RavenDB 5.4 and on can function as a _Producer_ in this architecture.  
  RavenDB 6.0 and on can also function as a _Consumer_.  
  <Admonition type="info" title="Info">
  This overview and the other pages in the Queue Sink section explain 
  **only** RavenDB's role as a _Consumer_ through the implementation of 
  a sink connector.  
  To learn about RavenDB's role as a _Producer_ please refer to the 
  [Queue ETL section](../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/queue-etl/overview.mdx).  
  </Admonition>
* RavenDB can run an ongoing Sink task that reads JSON formatted messages 
  from broker queues, apply a user-defined script that can, among other things, 
  construct documents from the retrieved messages, and potentially store 
  manufactured documents in RavenDB's database.  
* Supported broker queues currently include **Apache Kafka** and **RabbitMQ**.  

<Admonition type="info" title="Info">
Using RavenDB as a message broker sink can benefit users who want to combine 
Kafka or RabbitMQ's immense capability to collect and stream data with RavenDB's 
ability to process this data, reveal and exploit its value.
