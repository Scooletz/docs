# Fiddler Usage With Secured Database

When you want to use fiddler with secure database you need to configure fiddler that it could response and do requests as you.

## Respond to Requests Requiring a Client Certificate

First you need to create .CER file: 

1. Open Manege User certificates

2. Right-click the certificate in Personal Certificates Store.

3. Click All Tasks &gt; Export 

Then you need to specify the .CER file for Fiddler to return for a given session.

You have two options to do so:

1. Add a FiddlerScript to OnBeforeRequest function: 
<TabItem value="plain" label="plain">
<CodeBlock language="plain">
{`oSession["https-Client-Certificate"] = "C:\\\\test\\\\someCert.cer"; 
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
2. Place your .CER file in '%USERPROFILE%\My Documents\Fiddler2\ClientCertificate.cer' ( the name must be ClientCertificate.cer)

<Admonition type="warning" title="Warning">
If you do this your client certificate is exposed through fiddler
</Admonition>

## Accepting response by the client

* Option 1: Configure Windows Client to trust Fiddler Root Certificate

    1. Click Tools &gt; Fiddler Options &gt; HTTPS.

    2. Click the Decrypt HTTPS Traffic box.

    3. Next to `Trust the Fiddler Root certificate?`, click Yes.

    4. After `Do you want to install this certificate?`, click Yes.

<Admonition type="danger" title="Danger">
If you do this windows will automatically trust any certificate issued by this CA. This is a security risk!
</Admonition>

* Option 2: Client will ignore certificate validation

    In the application you should set:

    Raven.Client.Http.RequestExecutor.RemoteCertificateValidationCallback += (sender, cert, chain, errors) =&gt; true;

<Admonition type="danger" title="Danger">
If you do this and forget to remove it from your code, your client will accept any response!
</Admonition>
