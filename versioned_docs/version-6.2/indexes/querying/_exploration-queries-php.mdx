<Admonition type="note" title="">

* **Exploration Queries** form an additional layer of filtering that can be applied 
  to a dataset after its retrieval by [raw rql](../../client-api/session/querying/how-to-query.mdx#sessionadvancedrawquery), 
  while the dataset is still held by the server.  

* The **retrieved dataset** is scanned and filtered **without requiring or creating an 
  index**, providing a way to conduct one-time explorations without creating an index that would 
  have to be maintained by the cluster.  

* You can filter the datasets retrieved by both **Index queries** and **Collection queries**.  

* Exploration queries need to be used 
  [with caution](../../indexes/querying/exploration-queries.mdx#when-should-exploration-queries-be-used) 
  since scanning and filtering all the data retrieved by a query cost substantial 
  [server resources and user waiting time](../../indexes/querying/exploration-queries.mdx#limit-the-query-and-prefer--for-recurring-queries) 
  when large datasets are handled.  
    <Admonition type="warning" title="">

    We recommend that you -  

    * [Limit](../../indexes/querying/exploration-queries.mdx#limit-the-query-and-prefer--for-recurring-queries) 
      the number of records that an exploration query filters.  
    * Use [where](../../indexes/querying/filtering.mdx) in recurring queries, 
      so the query would [use an index](../../indexes/querying/exploration-queries.mdx#limit-the-query-and-prefer--for-recurring-queries).

## `filter`

Exploration queries can be applied via RQL using the `filter` keyword.  

The added filtering is parsed and executed by RavenDB's Javascript engine.  

The provided filtering operations resemble those implemented by 
[where](../../indexes/querying/filtering.mdx) and can be further enhanced 
by Javascript functions of your own.  
Read [here](../../indexes/querying/exploration-queries.mdx#with-user-defined-javascript-functions-) 
about creating and using your own Javascript function in your filters.  



## When should exploration queries be used

`filter` can be applied to a Collection query, like in:  
<TabItem value="sql" label="sql">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`from Employees as e 
filter e.Address.Country = 'USA'
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

it can also be applied to queries handled by an index, e.g. -  

<TabItem value="sql" label="sql">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`// in a dynamic query via an auto-index  
from Employees as e 
where e.Title = 'Sales Representative'  
filter e.Address.Country = 'USA'
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="sql" label="sql">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`// in a query that uses an index explicitly  
from index 'Orders/ByCompany' 
filter Count > 10
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

Both in a collection query and in a query handled by an index, the entire retrieved 
dataset is scanned and filtered.  
This helps understand when exploration queries should be used, why a Limit 
should be set for the number of filtered records, and when `where` should 
be preferred:  

<Admonition type="info" title="">
#### When to use
Use `filter` for an ad-hoc exploration of the retrieved dataset, that matches 
no existing index and is not expected to be repeated much.  

* You gain the ability to filter post-query results on the server side, for 
  both collection queries and when an index was used.  
* The dataset will be filtered without creating an unrequired index that the cluster 
  would continue updating from now on.  
</Admonition>
<Admonition type="warning" title="">
#### Limit the query, and prefer `where` for recurring queries 
Be aware that when a large dataset is retrieved, like the whole collection in 
the case of a collection query, exploring it all using `filter` would tax the server 
in memory and CPU usage while it checks the filter condition for each query result, 
and cost the user a substantial waiting time. Therefore -  

* **Limit** the number of records that an exploration query filters, e.g.:  
<TabItem value="sql" label="sql">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`from Employees as e 
filter e.Address.Country = 'USA'
filter_limit 500 // limit the number of filtered records
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
* Use [where](../../indexes/querying/filtering.mdx) rather than `filter` for recurring filtering.  
  `where` will use an index, creating it if necessary, to accelerate the filtering 
  in subsequent queries.  
</Admonition>



## Syntax

In an RQL query, use:  
The `filter` keyword, followed by the filtering condition.  
The `filter_limit` option, followed by the max number of records to filter.  

E.g. -  
<TabItem value="sql" label="sql">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`from Employees as e 
where e.Title = 'Sales Representative'  
filter e.Address.Country = 'USA' // filter the retrieved dataset
filter_limit 500 // limit the number of filter records
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>


## Usage examples

#### With collection queries

Use `filter` with a collection query to scan and filter the entire collection.  
<Tabs groupId='languageSyntax'>
<TabItem value="query" label="query">
<CodeBlock language="php">
{`$result = $session->query(Employee::class)
    ->filter(function($f) { return $f->equals("Address.Country", "USA"); }, 500)
    ->singleOrDefault();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="documentQuery" label="documentQuery">
<CodeBlock language="php">
{`$result = $session->advanced()->documentQuery(Employee::class)
    ->filter(function($p) { return $p->equals("Address.Country", "USA"); }, limit: 500)
    ->singleOrDefault();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="rawQuery" label="rawQuery">
<CodeBlock language="php">
{`$result = $session->advanced()
        ->rawQuery(
            Employee::class,
            "from Employees as e " .
               "filter e.Address.Country = 'USA' " .
               "filter_limit 500")
->singleOrDefault();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Admonition type="warning" title="">
Filtering a sizable collection will burden the server and prolong user waiting time.  
Set a `filter_limit` to restrict the number of filtered records.  
</Admonition>
#### With queries that use an index

Use `filter` after a `where` clause to filter the results retrieved by an index query.  
<Tabs groupId='languageSyntax'>
<TabItem value="query" label="query">
<CodeBlock language="php">
{`$emp = $session->query(Employee::class)
    ->whereEquals("Title", "Sales Representative")
    ->filter(function($f) { return $f->equals("Address.Country", "USA"); }, 500)
    ->singleOrDefault();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="documentQuery" label="documentQuery">
<CodeBlock language="php">
{`$emp = $session->advanced()->documentQuery(Employee::class)
      ->whereEquals("Title", "Sales Representative")
      ->filter(function($p) { return $p->equals("Address.Country", "USA"); }, limit: 500)
      ->singleOrDefault();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="rawQuery" label="rawQuery">
<CodeBlock language="php">
{`$emp = $session->advanced()->rawQuery(Employee::class,
    "from Employees as e" .
     "where e.Title = \\$title" .
     "filter e.Address.Country = \\$country" .
     "filter_limit \\$limit")
    ->addParameter("title", "Sales Representative")
    ->addParameter("country", "USA")
    ->addParameter("limit", 500)
    ->singleOrDefault();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
#### With projections

The filtered results can be projected using `select`, like those of any other query.  
<Tabs groupId='languageSyntax'>
<TabItem value="query" label="query">
<CodeBlock language="php">
{`$emp1 = $session
    ->query(Employee::class)
    ->filter(function($f) { return $f->equals("Address.Country", "USA"); }, 500)
    ->selectFields(null,  "Name", "Address.City", "Address.Country")
    ->toList();

    // Results:
    // ========

    // * Results include all companies with country = 'USA'
    //   Each resulting object contains only the selected fields.
    //
    // * No auto-index is created.
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="rawQuery" label="rawQuery">
<CodeBlock language="php">
{`$emp3 = $session->advanced()->rawQuery(
    Employee::class,
    "from Companies " .
        "filter Address.Country == 'USA'" .
        "select Name, Address.City, Address.Count\`"
);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
#### With user-defined JavaScript functions (`declare`)

You can define a Javascript function as part of your query using the 
[declare](../../client-api/session/querying/what-is-rql.mdx#declare) keyword, and 
use it as part of your `filter` condition to freely adapt the filtering 
to your needs.  

Here is a simple example:  
<TabItem value="sql" label="sql">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`// declare a Javascript function
declare function titlePrefix(r, prefix) 
\{ 
    // Add whatever filtering capabilities you like
    return r.Title.startsWith(prefix)
\} 

from Employees as e 

// Filter using the function you've declared
filter titlePrefix(e, $prefix)
filter_limit 100
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
