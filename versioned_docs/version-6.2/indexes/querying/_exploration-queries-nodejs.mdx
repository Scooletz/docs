* **Exploration Queries** form an additional layer of filtering that can be applied 
  to a dataset after its retrieval by [query](../../client-api/session/querying/how-to-query.mdx#sessionquery), 
  or [rawQuery](../../client-api/session/querying/how-to-query.mdx#sessionadvancedrawquery), 
  while the dataset is still held by the server.  

* The **retrieved dataset** is scanned and filtered **without requiring or creating an index**,  
  providing a way to conduct one-time explorations without creating an index that would have to be maintained by the cluster.  

* You can filter the datasets retrieved by both **Index queries** and **Collection queries**.  

* Exploration queries need to be used with caution when large datasets are handled
  since scanning and filtering all the data retrieved by a query costs substantial server resources and user waiting time.

<Admonition type="warning" title="">

    We recommend that you -  

  * **Limit** the number of records that an exploration query filters.  
  * Use [where](../../indexes/querying/filtering.mdx) in recurring queries, 
    so the query would [use an index](../../indexes/querying/exploration-queries.mdx#limit-the-query-and-prefer--for-recurring-queries).

## `filter`

Exploration queries can be applied using -  

* `query.filter` 
* RQL's `filter` keyword  

The added filtering is parsed and executed by RavenDB's Javascript engine.  

The provided filtering operations resemble those implemented by [where](../../indexes/querying/filtering.mdx) 
and can be further enhanced by Javascript functions of your own. 
Read [here](../../indexes/querying/exploration-queries.mdx#with-user-defined-javascript-functions-) about creating and using your own Javascript function in your filters.  



## When Should Exploration Queries Be Used

`filter` can be applied to a Full-Collection query, for example:

<TabItem value="sql" label="sql">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`// A full-collection query:
// ========================

from Employees as e
filter e.Address.Country == "USA"

// Results include only employees from USA
// No auto-index is created
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

It can also be applied to queries handled by an index:  

<TabItem value="sql" label="sql">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`// A dynamic query:
// ================

from Employees as e 
where e.Title == "Sales Representative" // This triggers auto-index creation
filter e.Address.Country == "USA"

// Results include only employees from USA having the specified title
// The auto-index created only indexes the 'Title' field
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="sql" label="sql">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`// A static-index query:
// =====================

from index "Orders/ByCompany" 
filter Count > 10

// Results include orders with Count > 10 using the specified static-index 
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

Both in a collection query and in a query handled by an index, all the results that are retrieved by the query are scanned and filtered by `filter`.  

<Admonition type="info" title="">

#### When to use

Use `filter` for an ad-hoc exploration of the retrieved dataset, that matches no existing index and is not expected to be repeated much.  

* You gain the ability to filter post-query results on the server side, for both collection queries and when an index was used.  
* The dataset will be filtered without creating an unrequired index that the cluster would continue updating from now on.
 
</Admonition>
 
<Admonition type="warning" title="">

#### Limit the query, and prefer `where` for recurring queries

Be aware that when a large dataset is retrieved, like the whole collection in the case of a collection query,  
exploring it using `filter` would tax the server in memory and CPU usage while it checks the filter condition for each query result, 
and cost the user a substantial waiting time. Therefore:  

* **Limit** the number of records that an exploration query filters, e.g.:  
<TabItem value="sql" label="sql">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`from Orders
// Apply filter
filter ShipTo.Country == "UK"
// Limit the number of records that will be scanned by the filter operation
filter_limit 100 

// While there are 830 records in the Orders collection, 
// only the first 100 records that are retrieved by the query are scanned by 'filter'
// Running this RQL on the sample data returns 4 matching results out of the 100 scanned.
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

* Use [where](../../indexes/querying/filtering.mdx) rather than `filter` for recurring filtering.  
  `where` will use an index, creating it if necessary, to accelerate the filtering in subsequent queries.

## Usage examples

#### With collection queries:

Use `filter` with a full-collection query to scan and filter the entire collection.

<Tabs groupId='languageSyntax'>
<TabItem value="Query" label="Query">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`const filteredCompanies = await session
     // Make a full-collection query
    .query({ collection: "companies" })
     // Apply a filter, scan only first 50 records from query results
    .filter(x => x.equals("Address.Country", "USA"), 50)
    .all();

// Results: 
// ========

// * While a full-collection query on the 'companies' colletion yields 91 results
//   only the first 50 records are scanned by the filter operation -
//   resulting in 5 matching documents.
//
// * No auto-index is created.
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="RawQuery" label="RawQuery">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`const filteredCompanies = await session
    .advanced
    .rawQuery("from Companies filter Address.Country == 'USA' filter_limit 50")
    .all();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="RQL" label="RQL">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`from "Companies" 
filter Address.Country == "USA"
filter_limit 50
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Admonition type="warning" title="">

Filtering a sizable collection will burden the server and prolong user waiting time.  
It is recommended to set a `filter_limit` to restrict the number of filtered records.  

</Admonition>
#### With queries that use an index:

Use `filter` after a `whereEquals` clause to filter the results retrieved by the query.  

<Tabs groupId='languageSyntax'>
<TabItem value="Query" label="Query">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`const filteredCompanies = await session
     // Make a dynamic query on a collection
    .query({ collection: "companies" })
     // Apply some condition - this will trigger auto-index creation
    .whereEquals("Contact.Title", "Sales Representative")
     // Apply a filter 
    .filter(x => x.equals("Address.Country", "Germany"))
    .all();

// Results: 
// ========

// * The dynamic query results (before applying the filter) contain 17 results.
//   Applying the filter results in 4 matching documents. 
//
// * Since a query predicate was applied (using 'whereEquals') 
//   an auto-index that is indexing field 'Contact.Title' is created.
//
// * Field 'Address.Country' is Not included in the auto-index
//   since it is part of the filter operation.
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="RawQuery" label="RawQuery">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`const filteredCompanies = await session
    .advanced
    .rawQuery(\`from Companies 
               where Contact.Title == 'Sales Representative'
               filter Address.Country == 'Germany'\`)
    .all();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="RQL" label="RQL">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`from "Companies"
where Contact.Title == "Sales Representative"
filter Address.Country == "Germany"
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
#### With projections:

The filtered results can be projected using `selectFields`, like those of any other query.  

<Tabs groupId='languageSyntax'>
<TabItem value="Query" label="Query">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`const filteredCompanies = await session
     // Make a collection query
    .query({ collection: "companies" })
     // Apply a filter 
    .filter(x => x.equals("Address.Country", "Germany"))
     // Any fields can be projected in the results
    .selectFields([ "Name", "Address.City", "Address.Country"])
    .all();

 // Results: 
 // ========

 // * Results include all companies with country = 'Germany'
 //   Each resluting object contains only the selected fields.
 //
 // * No auto-index is created.
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="RawQuery" label="RawQuery">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`const filteredCompanies = await session
    .advanced
    .rawQuery(\`from Companies 
               filter Address.Country == 'Germany'
               select Name, Address.City, Address.Count\`)
    .all();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="RQL" label="RQL">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`from "Companies"
filter Address.Country == "Germany"
select Name, Address.City, Address.Country
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
#### With user-defined JavaScript functions (`declare`):

When using RQL, you can define a JavaScript function using the [declare](../../client-api/session/querying/what-is-rql.mdx#declare) keyword.  
This function can then be used as part of your `filter` condition to further customize the results.  
For example:  

<TabItem value="sql" label="sql">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`// Declare a Javascript function:
// ==============================

declare function filterByTitlePrefix(employee, prefix) 
\{ 
    // Include any filtering logic that suits your needs
    return employee.Title.startsWith(prefix)
\} 

// Use the function in your RQL:
// =============================

from Employees as employee
// Filter using the declared function
filter filterByTitlePrefix(employee, "Sales")
filter_limit 10
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
