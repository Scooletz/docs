## `CounterBatchOperation` default increment Delta is 1

When [CounterBatchOperation](../../client-api/operations/counters/counter-batch) is 
called to `Increment` a batch of counters, and no `Delta` is specified to indicate 
what value should be added to the counters, the operation will increment the counters 
by a default `Delta`.  

  * Previous RavenDB versions set a default `Delta` of `0`, leaving the counters value unchanged.  
  * Starting RavenDB `6.2` the default `Delta` is `1` to make it consistent with the rest of the API.  

<TabItem value="something-something" label="CounterBatchOperation">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`var operationResult = store.Operations.Send(new CounterBatchOperation(new CounterBatch
\{
    Documents = new List<DocumentCountersOperation>
    \{
        new DocumentCountersOperation
        \{
            DocumentId = "users/1",
            Operations = new List<CounterOperation>
            \{
                new CounterOperation
                \{
                    Type = CounterOperationType.Increment,
                    CounterName = "likes",
                    Delta = 5
                \},
                new CounterOperation
                \{
                    // No delta specified, value will be incremented by 1
                    Type = CounterOperationType.Increment,
                    CounterName = "dislikes"
                \}
            \}
        \}
    \}
\}));
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## CmpXchg item can only be created with an index of 0

Creating a [compare exchange item](../../client-api/operations/compare-exchange/put-compare-exchange-value) 
using `PutCompareExchangeValueOperation` is now possible only if the `index` parameter 
passed to the method is `0`.  

<TabItem value="something-something" label="CmpXchg">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`// Creating the item will fail because the index is not 0
CompareExchangeResult<string> compareExchangeResult
    = store.Operations.Send(
        new PutCompareExchangeValueOperation<string>("key", "value", 123));

// Creating the item will succeed because the index is 0
compareExchangeResult = store.Operations.Send(
        new PutCompareExchangeValueOperation<string>("key", "value", 0));
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>  



## Dynamic Linq query cannot apply `.Any` with logical AND (`&&`)

RavenDB does not support dynamic Linq queries (i.e. queries executed over auto indexes) 
when they attempt to apply multiple conditions using the `.Any` method with a logical AND (`&&`).  
The below query, for example, is *not supported*.  

<TabItem value="something" label="sql">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`using (var store = new DocumentStore())
\{
    var guestsCarryingSmallSilverSuitcases = session.Query<Guest>()
        // Applying .Any with && is not supported
        .Where(x => x.Suitcase.Any(p => p.Size == "Small" && p.Color == "Silver"))
        .ToList();
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

<Admonition type="info" title="Info">
While _auto_ indexes do not currently support this type of query, _static_ indexes do.  
You can define a **static fanout index** that creates separate index entries for different 
document sub-objects, and run your query over these entries.  
Read about the indexing of nested data [here](../../indexes/indexing-nested-data),  
and find explanations and samples for fanout indexes [here](../../indexes/indexing-nested-data#fanout-index---multiple-index-entries-per-document).  
</Admonition>



## `LoadDocument` must be provided with a collection name String

When [LoadDocument](../../indexes/indexing-related-documents) is used in an index query 
to load related documents, it is passed a **document ID** and a **collection name**.  

The collection name **must** be passed to `LoadDocument` as a regular string; attempting 
to pass it a dynamic expression instead of a string will fail with an `IndexCompilationException` 
exception and this message: `LoadDocument method has to be called with constant value as collection name`

The following query, for example, will fail because it attempts to build the collection name dynamically.  

<TabItem value="something" label="sql">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`from doc in docs.Orders
select new \{
    // This attempt to construct a collection name will fail with an exception
    CompanyName = LoadDocument(doc.Company, doc.Company.Split('/')[0]).Name
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">
Note that the validation of the collection name string will be forced only during 
the creation of a **new** index. 
An attempt to update an existing index with a collection name expression rather 
than a string will fail but the failure will remain unnoticed and an exception 
will not be thrown.
</Admonition>



## Tracking operations using the Changes API now requires Node Tag

[Tracking operations using the changes API](../../client-api/changes/how-to-subscribe-to-operation-changes) 
now requires that you pass the changes API both a database name **and** a node tag for the specific node that 
runs the operation/s you want to track, to ensure that the API consistently tracks this selected node.  

The changes API can be opened using two `Changes` overloads. The first passes the API only the database name 
and is capable of tracking all entities besides operations. Attempting to track operations after opening the 
API this way will fail with an `ArgumentException` exception and the following message:  
`"Changes API must be provided a node tag in order to track node-specific operations."`

To track operations, open the API using this overload:  
<TabItem value="something-something" label="changes-definition">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`ISingleNodeDatabaseChanges Changes(string database, string nodeTag);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>  

Then, you can use `ForOperationId` or `ForAllOperations` to track a certain operation or all 
the operations executed by the selected node. Here's a simple usage example:  
<TabItem value="something-something" label="changes_ForOperationId">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`IDisposable subscription = store
    .Changes(database, nodeTag)
    .ForOperationId(operationId)
    .Subscribe(
        change =>
        \{
            switch (change.State.Status)
            \{
                case OperationStatus.InProgress:
                    //Do Something
                    break;
                case OperationStatus.Completed:
                    //Do Something
                    break;
                case OperationStatus.Faulted:
                    //Do Something
                    break;
                case OperationStatus.Canceled:
                    //Do Something
                    break;
                default:
                    throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException();
            \}
        \});
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>  
 


## Consistency in `null` handling

`IAsyncDocumentSession.LoadAsync` and `IAsyncLazySessionsOperations.LoadAsync` now 
do not throw an exception when they are passed `null`, becoming consistent with the 
behavior of the majority of RavenDB's methods.  

<TabItem value="something" label="csharp">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`// This will work without issues
IAsyncDocumentSession.LoadAsync(null)
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
