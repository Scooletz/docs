## Migration from RavenDB 5.x to 6.x

* RavenDB `6.x` supports in-place migration of data from RavenDB `5.x`.
* RavenDB `5.x` product licenses **do not apply** to RavenDB `6.x`.  
  To upgrade a valid `5.x` license to a RavenDB `6.x` license,  
  please use the **License upgrade tool** [as explained here](../../start/licensing/replace-license#upgrade-a-license-key-for-ravendb-6.x).

<Admonition type="warning" title="Warning">
Please note that once upgraded, RavenDB `6.x` cannot be downgraded to version `5.x`,  
and the migrated data will no longer be accessible via RavenDB `5.x`.  
**Please create a backup of your data before migrating.**  
</Admonition>



## Migration from RavenDB 4.x to RavenDB 5.x and 6.x

* RavenDB `5.x` supports in-place migration of data from RavenDB `4.x`.
  <Admonition type="info" title="Info">
  It is also possible to upgrade directly from version `4.x` to `6.x`,  
  but it is recommended to first upgrade RavenDB `4.x` to `5.x`, and then proceed from `5.x` to `6.x`.

## Migration from RavenDB 3.x

* The information above relates only to data migration from RavenDB `4.x` to `5.x`/`6.x` and from `5.x` to `6.x`.
