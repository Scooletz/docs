## Creating a sharded database

![Create New Database](./assets/studio-admin_create-new-database.png)

1. **Database View**  
   Click to create, view or edit database properties.  
2. **Create new database**  
   This button is available when no database has been created yet.  
   Click it to create a new database.  
2. **New database**  
   Click to create a new database.  
Initiating the creation of a new database as shown above will open 
the following view:  

![New Database Settings](./assets/studio-admin_new-database.png)

1. **Name**  
   Enter the database name.  
2. **Replication factor**  
   Decide the number of replicas the database will have.  
   If set to 1, there will be no replication.  
3. **Enable sharding**  
   Click to enable or disable sharding on this database.  
4. **Number of shards**  
   Set the number of shards the database will be comprised of.  
5. **Set nodes layout manually**  
   The layout determines which nodes host each shard, and whether 
   nodes can function as [orchestrators](../../sharding/overview.mdx#client-server-communication).  
   Enable this option to set the layout manually.  
   Disable to let RavenDB set it for you.  
6. **Orchestrator nodes**  
   Select which nodes can function as orchestrators.  
7. **Shards replication**  
   Select the nodes that host shard replicas.  
   The number of nodes available for each shard is determined 
   using the "Replication factor" box at the top.  
8. **Create**  
   Click to create the database.  
   


## Database View

After creating a database as explained above, the database will 
be available here:  

![Database View](./assets/studio-admin_database-view_01.png)

1. **Expand/Collapse distribution details**  
   Click to display or hide per-shard database details.  

     ![Expanded Details](./assets/studio-admin_database-view_expanded-details.png)

2. **Encryption status**  
   Informative icon: notify whether the database is encrypted or not.  
   
3. **Shard storage report**  
   Click to watch the shard's storage usage.  
     
      ![Select Shard](./assets/studio-admin_database-view_02_select-shard.png)

      Select the shard number and its replica node.    
      The storage report view will open.  

      ![Storage Report](./assets/studio-admin_database-view_03_storage-report.png)

4. **Documents view**  
   Click to view and edit documents.  
      
     ![Documents View](./assets/studio-admin_database-view_04_docs-view.png)

5. **Indexes view**  
   Click to open the [List of Indexes](../../studio/database/indexes/indexes-list-view.mdx) view.  
6. **Backups view**  
   Click to manage [backup tasks](../../studio/database/tasks/backup-task.mdx) and restore existing backups.  
7. **Manage group**  
   Click to manage the database group ([see below](../../sharding/administration/studio-admin.mdx#database-group)).  



## Database Group

The Database Group view allows you to appoint and dismiss 
[orchestrators](../../sharding/overview.mdx#client-server-communication) 
and add or remove [shards](../../sharding/overview.mdx#shards) and 
shard [replicas](../../sharding/overview.mdx#shard-replication).  

![Database Group](./assets/studio-admin_database-group.png)

1. **Add Shard**  
   Click to add a shard.  

      ![Add Shard](./assets/database-group_add-shard.png)
   
      Set the shard's replication factor and click **Add shard** (or **Cancel**).  
      The new shard will be added to the database group view.  

2. **Manage Orchestrators**  
   Add or remove orchestrator functionality to cluster nodes.  

    * **Add Orchestrator**  
      This option will be available only if there are still nodes that 
      an orchestrator hasn't been assigned for.  

        ![Add Orchestrator 1](./assets/database-group_add-orchestrator-01.png)

        Click **Add node** to add an orchestrator.  

        ![Add Orchestrator 2](./assets/database-group_add-orchestrator-02.png)

        Select an available node for the orchestrator and click **Add orchestrator** (or **Cancel**).  

    * **Remove Orchestrator**  

        ![Remove Orchestrator](./assets/database-group_remove-orchestrator.png)
      
        Click **Remove** to remove the orchestrator functionality from this node.  

3. **Manage Shards**  

    * **Add shard replica**  
      This option will be available only if there are still available 
      nodes for replicas of the selected shard.  
      
        ![Add Shard Replica 1](./assets/database-group_add-shard-replica-01.png)
      
        Click **Add node** to add a shard replica.  
      
        ![Add Shard Replica 2](./assets/database-group_add-shard-replica-02.png)

        Select a node for the replica.  
        If you want, you can also set a mentor node that will replicate 
        the data to the new replica.  
        Click "Add node" to create the new replica (or **Cancel**).  

    * **Remove shard replica**  
      
        ![Remove Shard Replica 1](./assets/database-group_remove-shard-replica-01.png)
      
        Click **Delete from group** to remove the shard replica from the database group.  
      
        ![Remove Shard Replica 2](./assets/database-group_remove-shard-replica-02.png)
      
        Click **Soft Delete** to stop replication to this node but keep the database files on it.  
        Click **Hard Delete** to stop replication to this node and **delete database files** from it.  
        <Admonition type="warning" title="Warning">
        Removing a shard is done by removing all its replicas.  
        Please be careful not to remove files that have no backup and may still be needed.
