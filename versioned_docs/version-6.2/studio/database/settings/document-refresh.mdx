# Document Refresh
<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

* Use this view to configure the **Document Refresh** feature.  
* Documents can be scheduled for refresh by a `@refresh` property in their `@metadata`.  
* When the document refresh feature is enabled, it routinely checks for documents that 
  include the `@refresh` property and refreshes them on the scheduled time.  
  When a document is refreshed its [change vector](../../server/clustering/replication/change-vector) 
  is incremented, triggering its re-indexation and other features that react to document updates.  
* Documents are refreshed only once: after refreshing a document, the refresh feature removes 
  the `@refresh` property from its `@metadata`.  
* Learn more about this option [here](../../../server/extensions/refresh).
