## New Database From Backup - Studio Databases View

![Figure 1. Create New Database From Backup](./assets/new-database-from-backup-1.png)

 1. Click on the **Databases** tab in the Studio.  
 2. Click the down arrow on the **New database** button.  
 3. Select **New database from backup**  



## New Database From Backup - Studio Backups View
Another way to access the New Database From Backup interface is via the Studio Backups view.

![Figure 1. Create New Database From Backup](./assets/backup-task-view1.png)

1. Click the **Tasks** tab and select **Backups**.
2. Click the **Restore a database from a backup** button.



## Backup Source Configuration

![Figure 2. Backup Source Configuration](./assets/new-database-from-backup-2.png)

1. [**Name** your new database](../../../studio/database/create-new-database/general-flow.mdx#2-database-name).  

2. **Source**  
   Select the source server type to see the fields necessary to access the backup
   * If you use an [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) custom host:
     ![ForcePathStyle](./assets/studio-force-path-style.png)
      * a- **Use a custom S3 host**  
        Toggle to provide a custom server URL.  
      * b- **Force path style**  
        Toggle to change the default S3 bucket [path convention](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-path-deprecation-plan-the-rest-of-the-story/) on your custom Amazon S3 host.  


3. **Backup Directory**  
   Select the file location that you set when you [created your backup](../../../studio/database/tasks/backup-task.mdx).  
    * If your source is a cloud-based database, you will likely need to enter credentials and passwords as well as location.  

4. **Disable ongoing tasks after restore**  
   Disabling will likely require [ongoing tasks](../../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/general-info.mdx) to be created again.  

5. **Skip indexes**  
   Skipping [indexes](../../../indexes/what-are-indexes.mdx) will require your indexes to be built anew.  

6. **Restore Point** 
   Choose the backup version which will populate your new, restored database.  
   * **Snapshot** backup type includes fully built indexes which makes restoring the database faster.  
   * **Full** or **Incremental** types include index definitions from which the new indexes will be built.

#### Setting Up High Availability After Restoration 

The backup will be restored only on the current node after restoration.  
To create a database group of at least 3 nodes this database can be added to other nodes 
using the "Add node" button in the [Manage group](../../../studio/database/settings/manage-database-group.mdx#database-group-topology---actions) 
Studio view.

## Importing Backups into a Sharded Database

* The backup of a non-sharded database **cannot** be restored as a new sharded database.  
* The backup of a non-sharded database **can**, however, be imported into an existing sharded database.  
  Read more about this option [here](../../../sharding/migration.mdx#backup).
