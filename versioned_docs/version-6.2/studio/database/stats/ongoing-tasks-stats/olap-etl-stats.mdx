# Ongoing Tasks Stats: OLAP ETL Stats
<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

* **OLAP ETL** is a process that reads data from a RavenDB database, 
  transforms it, and stores it in a parquet format, ready for **OnLine 
  Analytical Processing** (OLAP).  
* Learn more about the OLAP ETL task [here](../../../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/olap-etl-task).
