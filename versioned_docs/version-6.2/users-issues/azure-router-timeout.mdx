#The Azure Router Timeout

## Symptoms

- An exception is thrown in RavenDB Client when accessing RavenDB Server. The exception was because of a socket timeout or general connection failure.
- Problem happens mainly on Azure hosted VMs

## Cause

Azure's Load Balancer closes connections that are idle for more than 60 seconds.

## Resolution

We have to make sure that there are no connections that are idle for more than 60 seconds.

There are two possible ways to do that:

- Make sure that RavenDB is accessed at least once a minute (consider having a keep-alive message)
- Change the service point manager's [MaxIdleTime](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.servicepointmanager.maxservicepointidletime?view=net-5.0);k(TargetFrameworkMoniker-.NETFramework,Version%3Dv4.5);k(DevLang-csharp)&rd=true) value in your client application 

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">
RavenDB is using heartbeats in 3-10 second intervals on all its internal communication channels so they will be kept open.
