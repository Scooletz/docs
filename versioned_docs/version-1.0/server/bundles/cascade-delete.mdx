#Cascade Delete Bundle
The cascade delete bundle allows for a specified set of documents and attachments to be deleted when the document that owns it is deleted. Typical usage scenarios include deleting an attachment that is referenced by a document or removing a set of child documents referenced by a parent document.

## Installation
Simply place the Raven.Bundles.CascadeDelete.dll in the Plugins directory.

## Usage
You can specify the documents and attachments to be cascade deleted using the following code:

<TabItem value="cascadedelete1" label="cascadedelete1">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`using (var session = documentStore.OpenSession())
\{
	session.Store(parent);
	session.Advanced.GetMetadataFor(parent)["Raven-Cascade-Delete-Documents"] = RavenJArray.FromObject(new[] \{ "childId1", "childId2" \});
	session.Advanced.GetMetadataFor(parent)["Raven-Cascade-Delete-Attachments"] = RavenJArray.FromObject(new[] \{ "attachmentId1", " attachmentId2" \});
	session.SaveChanges();
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

When the "parent" document is deleted, the documents with IDs "childId1" and "childId2" and the attachments with IDs "attachmentId1" and "attachmentId2" will be deleted as well.

**Notes:**

1. The "Raven-Cascade-Delete-Documents" and "Raven-Cascade-Delete-Attachments" collections are independent of each other; a document can specify from zero to any number of either documents or attachments to be cascade deleted.
2. Cascade Delete works only within a single node. If you have a sharded data set, cascading will not delete documents / attachments that are located on other nodes.
