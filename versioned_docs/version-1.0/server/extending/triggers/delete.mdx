#Delete Triggers
Delete triggers implement the AbstractDeleteTrigger interface and follow much the same pattern as PUT triggers.

![Figure 1: Triggers - Delete](./assets/triggers_delete_docs.png)

**Example: Cascading deletes**

    
```
public class CascadeDeleteTrigger : AbstractDeleteTrigger
    {
    
        public override void OnDelete(string key, TransactionInformation txInfo)
        {
            var document = Database.Get(key, txInfo);
            if (document == null)
                return;
            Database.Delete(document.Metadata.Value&lt;string&gt;("Cascade-Delete"), null, txInfo);
        }
```

    }

In this case, we perform another delete operation as part of the current delete operation. This operation is done under the same transaction as the original operation.
