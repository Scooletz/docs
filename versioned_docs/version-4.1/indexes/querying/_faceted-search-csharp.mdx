When displaying a large amount of data, paging is often used to make viewing the data manageable. It's also useful to give some context of the entire data-set and a easy way to drill-down into particular categories. The common approach to doing this is a "faceted search", as shown in the image below. __Note__ how the count of each category within the current search is across the top.

&lt;br /&gt;
Let's start with defining a document like this:

<TabItem value="camera" label="camera">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`public class Camera
\{
	public DateTime DateOfListing \{ get; set; \}

	public string Model \{ get; set; \}

	public decimal Cost \{ get; set; \}

	public int Zoom \{ get; set; \}

	public double Megapixels \{ get; set; \}

	public bool ImageStabilizer \{ get; set; \}

	public string Manufacturer \{ get; set; \}
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

## Step 1

Create an index to work against. 

<TabItem value="step_2" label="step_2">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`public class Cameras_ByManufacturerModelCostDateOfListingAndMegapixels : AbstractIndexCreationTask<Camera>
\{
    public Cameras_ByManufacturerModelCostDateOfListingAndMegapixels()
    \{
        Map = cameras => from camera in cameras
                         select new
                         \{
                             camera.Manufacturer,
                             camera.Model,
                             camera.Cost,
                             camera.DateOfListing,
                             camera.Megapixels
                         \};
    \}
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

## Step 2

Setup your facet definitions:

<TabItem value="step_1" label="step_1">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`List<FacetBase> facets = new List<FacetBase>
\{
    new Facet
    \{
        FieldName = "Manufacturer"
    \},
    new RangeFacet<Camera>
    \{
        Ranges =
        \{
            camera => camera.Cost < 200m,
            camera => camera.Cost >= 200m && camera.Cost < 400m,
            camera => camera.Cost >= 400m && camera.Cost < 600m,
            camera => camera.Cost >= 600m && camera.Cost < 800m,
            camera => camera.Cost >= 800m
        \}
    \},
    new RangeFacet<Camera>
    \{
        Ranges =
        \{
            camera => camera.Megapixels < 3.0,
            camera => camera.Megapixels >= 3.0 && camera.Megapixels < 7.0,
            camera => camera.Megapixels >= 7.0 && camera.Megapixels < 10.0,
            camera => camera.Megapixels >= 10.0
        \}
    \}
\};
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

This tells RavenDB that you would like to get the following facets:

* For the **Manufacturer** field, look at the documents and return a count for each unique Term found.

* For the **Cost** field, return the count of the following ranges:

 * Cost &lt; 200.0
 * 200.0 &lt;= Cost &lt; 400.0
 * 400.0 &lt;= Cost &lt; 600.0
 * 600.0 &lt;= Cost &lt; 800.0
 * Cost &gt;= 800.0
* For the **Megapixels** field, return the count of the following ranges:
 * Megapixels &lt;= 3.0
 * 3.0 &lt;= Megapixels &lt; 7.0
 * 7.0 &lt;= Megapixels &lt; 10.0
 * Megapixels &gt;= 10.0

## Step 3

You can write the following code to get back the data below:

<Tabs groupId='languageSyntax'>
<TabItem value="Query" label="Query">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`Dictionary<string, FacetResult> facetResults = session
    .Query<Camera, Cameras_ByManufacturerModelCostDateOfListingAndMegapixels>()
    .Where(x => x.Cost >= 100 && x.Cost <= 300)
    .AggregateBy(facets)
    .Execute();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="DocumentQuery" label="DocumentQuery">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`Dictionary<string, FacetResult> facetResults = session
    .Advanced
    .DocumentQuery<Camera, Cameras_ByManufacturerModelCostDateOfListingAndMegapixels>()
    .WhereBetween(x => x.Cost, 100, 300)
    .AggregateBy(facets)
    .Execute();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Facets" label="Facets">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`List<FacetBase> facets = new List<FacetBase>
{
    new Facet
    {
        FieldName = "Manufacturer"
    },
    new RangeFacet<Camera>
    {
        Ranges =
        {
            camera => camera.Cost < 200m,
            camera => camera.Cost >= 200m && camera.Cost < 400m,
            camera => camera.Cost >= 400m && camera.Cost < 600m,
            camera => camera.Cost >= 600m && camera.Cost < 800m,
            camera => camera.Cost >= 800m
        }
    },
    new RangeFacet<Camera>
    {
        Ranges =
        {
            camera => camera.Megapixels < 3.0,
            camera => camera.Megapixels >= 3.0 && camera.Megapixels < 7.0,
            camera => camera.Megapixels >= 7.0 && camera.Megapixels < 10.0,
            camera => camera.Megapixels >= 10.0
        }
    }
};
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="RQL" label="RQL">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`from index 'Cameras/ByManufacturerModelCostDateOfListingAndMegapixels' 
where Cost between 100 and 300
select facet(Manufacturer), facet(Cost <= 200, Cost between 200 and 400, Cost between 400 and 600, Cost between 600 and 800, Cost >= 800), facet(Megapixels <= 3, Megapixels between 3 and 7, Megapixels between 7 and 10, Megapixels >= 10)
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This data represents the sample faceted data that satisfies the above query:

<TabItem value="json" label="json">
<CodeBlock language="json">
{`[
    \{
        "Name": "Manufacturer",
        "Values": [
            \{
                "Count": 1,
                "Range": "canon"
            \},
            \{
                "Count": 2,
                "Range": "jessops"
            \},
            \{
                "Count": 1,
                "Range": "nikon"
            \},
            \{
                "Count": 1,
                "Range": "phillips"
            \},
            \{
                "Count": 3,
                "Range": "sony"
            \}
        ]
    \},
    \{
        "Name": "Cost",
        "Values": [
            \{
                "Count": 6,
                "Range": "Cost <= 200"
            \},
            \{
                "Count": 2,
                "Range": "Cost between 200 and 400"
            \},
            \{
                "Count": 0,
                "Range": "Cost between 400 and 600"
            \},
            \{
                "Count": 0,
                "Range": "Cost between 600 and 800"
            \},
            \{
                "Count": 0,
                "Range": "Cost >= 800"
            \}
        ]
    \},
    \{
        "Name": "Megapixels",
        "Values": [
            \{
                "Count": 0,
                "Range": "Megapixels <= 3"
            \},
            \{
                "Count": 6,
                "Range": "Megapixels between 3 and 7"
            \},
            \{
                "Count": 1,
                "Range": "Megapixels between 7 and 10"
            \},
            \{
                "Count": 1,
                "Range": "Megapixels >= 10"
            \}
        ]
    \}
]
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

### Storing Facets

If you do not have to change your facets dynamically, you can store your facets as a `FacetSetup` document and pass the document ID instead of the list each time:

<TabItem value="step_4_0" label="step_4_0">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`session.Store(new FacetSetup \{ Id = "facets/CameraFacets", Facets = facets, RangeFacets = rangeFacets \});
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

<Tabs groupId='languageSyntax'>
<TabItem value="Query" label="Query">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`Dictionary<string, FacetResult> facetResults = session
    .Query<Camera, Cameras_ByManufacturerModelCostDateOfListingAndMegapixels>()
    .Where(x => x.Cost >= 100 && x.Cost <= 300)
    .AggregateUsing("facets/CameraFacets")
    .Execute();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="DocumentQuery" label="DocumentQuery">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`Dictionary<string, FacetResult> facetResults = session
    .Advanced
    .DocumentQuery<Camera, Cameras_ByManufacturerModelCostDateOfListingAndMegapixels>()
    .WhereBetween(x => x.Cost, 100, 300)
    .AggregateUsing("facets/CameraFacets")
    .Execute();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Facets" label="Facets">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`List<FacetBase> facets = new List<FacetBase>
{
    new Facet
    {
        FieldName = "Manufacturer"
    },
    new RangeFacet<Camera>
    {
        Ranges =
        {
            camera => camera.Cost < 200m,
            camera => camera.Cost >= 200m && camera.Cost < 400m,
            camera => camera.Cost >= 400m && camera.Cost < 600m,
            camera => camera.Cost >= 600m && camera.Cost < 800m,
            camera => camera.Cost >= 800m
        }
    },
    new RangeFacet<Camera>
    {
        Ranges =
        {
            camera => camera.Megapixels < 3.0,
            camera => camera.Megapixels >= 3.0 && camera.Megapixels < 7.0,
            camera => camera.Megapixels >= 7.0 && camera.Megapixels < 10.0,
            camera => camera.Megapixels >= 10.0
        }
    }
};
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="RQL" label="RQL">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`from index 'Cameras/ByManufacturerModelCostDateOfListingAndMegapixels' 
where Cost between 100 and 300
select facet(id('facets/CameraFacets'))
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Stale Results

The faceted search does not take into account a staleness of an index. You can wait for non stale results by customizing your query with the `WaitForNonStaleResults` method.

### Fluent API

As an alternative for creating a list of facets and passing it to the `AggregateBy` method, RavenDB also exposes a dynamic API where you can create your facets using a builder. You can read more about those methods in our dedicated Client API article [here](../../client-api/session/querying/how-to-perform-a-faceted-search.mdx).
