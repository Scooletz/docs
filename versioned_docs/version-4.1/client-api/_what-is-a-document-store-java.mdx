A document store is our main client API object which establishes and manages the connection channel between an application and a database instance. 
It acts as the connection manager and also exposes methods to perform all operations which you can run against an associated server instance.

The document store object has a list of URL addresses that points to RavenDB server nodes.

* `DocumentStore` acts against a remote server via HTTP requests, implementing a common `IDocumentStore` interface

The document store ensures access to the following client API features:

* [Session](../client-api/session/what-is-a-session-and-how-does-it-work.mdx)
* [Operations](../client-api/operations/what-are-operations.mdx)
* [Conventions](../client-api/configuration/conventions.mdx)
* [Events](../client-api/session/how-to/subscribe-to-events.mdx)
* [Bulk insert](../client-api/bulk-insert/how-to-work-with-bulk-insert-operation.mdx)
* [Changes API](../client-api/changes/what-is-changes-api.mdx)
