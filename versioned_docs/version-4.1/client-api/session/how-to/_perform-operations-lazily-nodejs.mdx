Operation execution for operations such as `load`, `load with includes`, `loadStartingWith` and queries can be deferred till needed using **lazy session operations**. Those operations can be accessed using `lazily()` property found in `advanced` session operations.

## Operations

Available operations are:

- `load` - described [here](../../../client-api/session/loading-entities.mdx#load).
- `load with includes` - described [here](../../../client-api/session/loading-entities.mdx#load-with-includes).
- `loadStartingWith` - described [here](../../../client-api/session/loading-entities.mdx#loadstartingwith).

## Querying

Dedicated article about lazy queries can be found [here](../../../client-api/session/querying/how-to-perform-queries-lazily.mdx).

## Example

<TabItem value="lazy_1" label="lazy_1">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`const employeeLazy = session
    .advanced
    .lazily
    .load("employees/1-A");

const employee = await employeeLazy.getValue(); // load operation will be executed here
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

## Executing All Pending Lazy Operations

To execute all pending lazy operations use `executeAllPendingLazyOperations()` method from **eager session operations** found under `eagerly` property in `advanced` session operations.

<TabItem value="lazy_2" label="lazy_2">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`const employeesLazy = session
    .query(\{ collection: "Employees" \})
    .lazily();

await session.advanced.eagerly.executeAllPendingLazyOperations(); // query will be executed here

const employees = await employeesLazy.getValue();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
