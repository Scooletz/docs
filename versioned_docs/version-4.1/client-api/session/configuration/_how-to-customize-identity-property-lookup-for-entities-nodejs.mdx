The client must know which property of your entity is considered as an identity. By default, it always looks for the `id` field (case-sensitive). This behavior can be changed by overwriting one of our conventions called `identityProperty`.

## Syntax

<TabItem value="identity_1" label="identity_1">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`store.conventions.identityProperty;
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

## Example

Here's how to change it to `Identifier` field.

<TabItem value="identity_2" label="identity_2">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`store.conventions.identityProperty = "Identifier"; 
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
