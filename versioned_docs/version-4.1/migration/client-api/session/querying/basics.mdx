# Migration: How to migrate Queries from 3.x?

Following changes occurred in 4.0 and need to be considered when migration is done.

## Namespaces

The following namespaces are no longer valid and have to be removed:

- Raven.Client.Linq
- Raven.Json.Linq



## Paging

There is no longer a default page size send from the client API (128 by default) and maximum page size that to which server will cut the results (1024 by default).

Following query will return **all** results from the database (even when there is 1M of them):

<TabItem value="basics_1_0" label="basics_1_0">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`List<Employee> employees = session
    .Query<Employee>()
    .ToList();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

What can be done to mitigate this?

1. `DocumentConventions.ThrowIfQueryPageSizeIsNotSet` can be set to **true** so all queries will throw if their page size is not explicitly set (even when you have just a few records in the database, check is done on the client-side before request is sent to the server).
2. Set on all queries maximum number of results that you expect using `.Take(pageSize)` method.

To fix previous example we will set the convention to `true` and add `Take` to the query:

<TabItem value="basics_1_2" label="basics_1_2">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`store.Conventions.ThrowIfQueryPageSizeIsNotSet = true;
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="basics_1_1" label="basics_1_1">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`List<Employee> employees = session
    .Query<Employee>()
    .Take(128)
    .ToList();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

<Admonition type="info" title="Performance Hint" id="performance-hint" href="#performance-hint">

If the number of records exceeds 2048 (default value that can be changed by `PerformanceHints.MaxNumberOfResults` configuration option) then performance hint notification will be issued and visible in the Studio. Giving you enough information to perform counter-measures if necessary.

</Admonition>

You can read more about paging in our [dedicated article](../../../../indexes/querying/paging.mdx).



## Transformers and Projections

Transformers have been removed from the RavenDB. Please read our migration article tackling this change. The article can be found [here](../../../../migration/client-api/session/querying/transformers.mdx).



## Default Operator

Default operator for `session.Query` was and still is `AND`, but the operator for `DocumentQuery` have changed from `OR` to `AND`. We have created a dedicated article that helps you with migration. It can be found [here](../../../../migration/client-api/session/querying/documentquery.mdx).



## Waiting for Non Stale Results

The following methods have been removed:

- `WaitForNonStaleResultsAsOf`
- `WaitForNonStaleResultsAsOfNow`

You should use `WaitForNonStaleResults` instead. Its behavior has changed in 4.0 - it's like `WaitForNonStaleResultsAsOfNow` in 3.x. Please read a dedicated article discussing [how to deal with non stale results](../../../../indexes/stale-indexes.mdx).

<TabItem value="basics_1_3" label="basics_1_3">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`List<Employee> employees = session
    .Query<Employee>()
    .Customize(x => x.WaitForNonStaleResults())
    .ToList();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## Raven/DocumentsByEntityName index

`Raven/DocumentsByEntityName` is no longer necessary in RavenDB 4.0. You can perform queries directly on collections, in particular we support queries that you can run to modify the docs:

| 3.x | 4.0 |
|:---:|:---:|
|
<TabItem value="basics_1_5" label="basics_1_5">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`var tagName = session
                .Advanced
                .DocumentStore
                .Conventions
                .GetTypeTagName(typeof(User));

session.Advanced.DocumentStore.DatabaseCommands
    .DeleteByIndex(Constants.DocumentsByEntityNameIndex, 
        new IndexQuery()
        \{
            Query = $"Tag:\{ tagName \}"
        \});
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
|
<TabItem value="basics_1_6" label="basics_1_6">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`var operation = store.Operations.Send(
    new DeleteByQueryOperation(new IndexQuery()
    \{
        Query = session.Query<User>().ToString() // "from Users"
    \}));
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
|



## RavenQueryStatistics

`RavenQueryStatistics` has been renamed to `QueryStatistics`.



## As

`As` has been removed in favor to built-in LINQ method `OfType`.



## ProjectFromIndexFieldsInto

`ProjectFromIndexFieldsInto` has been renamed to `ProjectInto`.
