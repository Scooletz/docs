## License types

<Admonition type="info" title="Info">
Visit the [pricing page](https://ravendb.net/buy) to see which features are included with each license type.
</Admonition>
### Developer

* The developer license is for development use only and isn't applicable for commercial use.  
  You must upgrade this license before going into production.   
* It is fully featured but temporary - license lasts 6 months and can be renewed.  
* Certificates exceeding 4 months expiration period are Not allowed to be used with this license.  
  Automatic renewal of Letâ€™s Encrypt certificates is disabled.  
* When you are ready to go into production:  
  * Be sure to choose a license that has all features with which your client was developed.  
  * [Upgrade to a production license](https://ravendb.net/buy) and then [replace](../../start/licensing/replace-license.mdx) the developer license.  
  
* The developer license can be obtained [here](https://ravendb.net/buy#developer).
### Community

* A basic production-grade license.
* Community licenses last one year and can be renewed every year.  
* Servers using a Community license are **required to run the latest major version**.  
  E.g., if RavenDB `7.0` is released and your server runs RavenDB `6.2` with a Community license, 
  you will be required to upgrade RavenDB to version `7.0`.  
  Running a major version older than the latest with a Community license will **block your server's access to Studio**.
### Professional

* A standard production-grade license.  
* Extended automatically if the server has access to RavenDB's License Server.  
### Enterprise

* A high-performance, fully-featured production-grade license.  
* Extended automatically if the server has access to RavenDB's License Server.  
### ISV Licenses

* ISV licenses are commercial licenses that allow you to redistribute RavenDB with your software  
  for on-premise installation and use by your customers.  
* Available ISV license types are: Essential, Professional, and Enterprise.  
* [Contact RavenDB for more details](https://ravendb.net/contact).
