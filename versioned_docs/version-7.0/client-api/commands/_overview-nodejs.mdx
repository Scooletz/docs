<Admonition type="note" title="">

* RavenDB's Client API is structured in layers.  
  At the highest layer, you interact with the [document store](../../client-api/what-is-a-document-store.mdx) and the [document session](../../client-api/session/what-is-a-session-and-how-does-it-work.mdx),  
  which handle most common database tasks like loading, saving, and querying documents.

* Beneath this high-level interface are Operations and Commands:

    * **Operations**:

        * Operations provide management functionality outside the session's context,  
          like creating a database, performing bulk actions, or managing server-wide configurations.

        * Learn more about Operations in [what are Operations](../../client-api/operations/what-are-operations.mdx).

    * **Commands**:

        * All high-level methods and Operations are built on top of Commands.  
          Commands form the lowest-level operations that directly communicate with the server.

        * For example, a sessionâ€™s _Load_ method translates internally to a _LoadOperation_,  
          which ultimately relies on a _GetDocumentsCommand_ to fetch data from the server.

        * Commands are responsible for sending the appropriate request to the server using a `Request Executor`,  
          and parsing the server's response.

      * All commands can be executed using either the [Store's _Request Executor_](../../client-api/commands/overview.mdx#execute-command---using-the-store)
        or the [Session's _Request Executor_](../../client-api/commands/overview.mdx#execute-command---using-the-session),  
        regardless of whether the command is session-related or not.

* This layered structure lets you work at any level, depending on your needs.

* In this page:
    * [Execute command - using the Store Request Executor](../../client-api/commands/overview.mdx#execute-command---using-the-store-request-executor)
    * [Execute command - using the Session Request Executor](../../client-api/commands/overview.mdx#execute-command---using-the-session-request-executor)

## Execute command - using the Store Request Executor

This example shows how to execute the low-level `CreateSubscriptionCommand` via the **Store**.  
(For examples of creating a subscription using higher-level methods, see [subscription creation examples](../../client-api/data-subscriptions/creation/examples.mdx)).

<TabItem value="execute_1" label="execute_1">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`// Define a command
const cmd = new CreateSubscriptionCommand(\{
    name: "Orders subscription",
    query: "from Orders"
\});

// Call 'execute' on the store's Request Executor to run the command on the server
// Pass the command
await documentStore.getRequestExecutor().execute(cmd);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## Execute command - using the Session Request Executor

This example shows how to execute the low-level `GetDocumentsCommand` via the **Session**.  
(For loading a document using higher-level methods, see [loading entities](../../client-api/session/loading-entities.mdx)).

<TabItem value="execute_2" label="execute_2">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`const session = documentStore.openSession();

// Define a command
const cmd = new GetDocumentsCommand(
    \{ conventions: documentStore.conventions, id: "orders/1-A" \});

// Call 'execute' on the session's Request Executor to run the command on the server
// Pass the command
await session.advanced.requestExecutor.execute(cmd);

// Access the results
const order = command.result.results[0];
const orderedAt = order.OrderedAt;
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

* Note that the transaction created for the HTTP request when executing the command  
  is separate from the transaction initiated by the session's [SaveChanges](../../client-api/session/saving-changes.mdx) method,  
  even if both are called within the same code block.

* Learn more about transactions in RavenDB in [Transaction support](../../client-api/faq/transaction-support.mdx).
