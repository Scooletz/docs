# HiLo Algorithm
<LanguageSwitcher supportedLanguages={supportedLanguages} />
<LanguageContent language="csharp">

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

* The HiLo algorithm is the default method used by a RavenDB client to generate unique document IDs when storing a new document **without explicitly providing an `Id` value**.

* It is an efficient solution used by the [session](../session/what-is-a-session-and-how-does-it-work) to generate the numeric part of the document identifier.  
  These numeric values are then combined with the collection name and server node-tag to create document identifiers such as `orders/10-A` or `products/93-B`.

* An example of storing a document without specifying its `Id` is available in section [Autogenerated HiLo IDs](../../client-api/document-identifiers/working-with-document-identifiers#autogenerated-ids).

## How the HiLo algorithm works in RavenDB

### Generating unique IDs efficiently:

**The client creates IDs from a range of unique numbers that it gets from the server.**  
The HiLo algorithm is efficient because the client can automatically generate unique document IDs 
without checking with the server or cluster each time a new document is created to ensure that the new ID is unique.  
The client receives from the server a range of numbers that are reserved for the client's usage.

Each time a session creates a new document, the client assigns the new document an ID based on the next number from that range.
For example, the first client to generate documents on a collection will receive the reserved numbers 1-32. The next one will reserve numbers 33-64, and so on.  

**The collection name and node-tag are added to the ID.**  
To further ensure that no two clients generate a document with the same ID, the collection name and the server node-tag are added to the ID. 
This is an added measure so that if two nodes B and C are working with the same range of numbers, the IDs generated will be `orders/54-B` and `orders/54-C`.  
This situation is rare because as long as the nodes can communicate when requesting a range of numbers, the clients will receive a different range of numbers. 
The node-tag is added to ensure unique IDs across the cluster.  

Thus, with minimal trips to the server, the client is able to determine to which collection an entity belongs  
and automatically assign it a number with a node-tag to ensure that the ID is unique across the cluster.
### Using HiLo documents:

**HiLo documents are used by the server to provide the next range of numbers.**  
To ensure that multiple clients can generate identifiers simultaneously without producing duplicates,  
a mechanism is needed to avoid duplication.  

This is handled by `Raven/HiLo/<collection>` documents, stored in the `@hilo` collection in the database.  
These documents are created and modified by the server and have a simple structure:

<TabItem value="something" label="json">
<CodeBlock language="json">
{`\{
    "Max": 32,
    "@metadata": \{
        "@collection": "@hilo"
    \}
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

The `Max` property means the maximum possible number that has been used by any client to create the identifier for a given collection. It is used as follows:

1. The client asks the server for a range of numbers that it can use to create a document.  
   (32 is the initial capacity, but the range size can dynamically expand based on how frequently the client requests HiLo ranges).
2. Then, the server checks the HiLo file to see what is the last "Max" number it sent to any client for this collection.
3. The client will get the min and the max values it can use from the server (33 - 64 in our case).
4. Then, the client creates a range object using the values received from the server.  
   This range object is then used to generate unique document IDs as needed.
5. When the client reaches the max limit, it will repeat the process.



## Returning HiLo ranges

When the document store is disposed, the client sends the server the last value it used to create an identifier 
and the max value that was previously received from the server.

If the max value on the server-side is equal to the max value of the client and 
the last used value by the client is smaller or equal to the max of the server-side, 
the server will update the `Max` value to the last used value by the client.

<TabItem value="something" label="hilo_1">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`var store = new DocumentStore();

using (var session = store.OpenSession())
\{
    // Storing the first entity causes the client to receive the initial HiLo range (1-32)
    session.Store(new Employee
    \{
        FirstName = "John",
        LastName = "Doe"
    \});

    session.SaveChanges(); 
    // The document ID will be: employees/1-A
\}

// Release the range when it is no longer relevant
store.Dispose();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

`store.Dispose()` is used in this example to demonstrate that the range is released.  
In normal use, the `store` should only be disposed when the application is closed.

After execution of the code above, the `Max` value of the Hilo document for the _Employees_ collection in the server will be 1. 
That's because the client used only one identifier from the range it got before we disposed the store.

The next time that a client asks for a range of numbers from the server for this collection it will get (in our example) the range 2 - 33.

<TabItem value="something" label="hilo_2">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`var newStore = new DocumentStore();
using (var session = newStore.OpenSession())
\{
    // Storing an entity after disposing the store in the previous example
    // causes the client to receive the next HiLo range (2-33)
    session.Store(new Employee
    \{
        FirstName = "Dave",
        LastName = "Brown"
    \});

    session.SaveChanges();
    // The document ID will be: employees/2-A
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



<Admonition type="info" title="Info">

#### Identity parts separator
* By default, document IDs created by the server use the character `/` to separate their components.  

* This separator can be customized to any other character, except `|`, by setting the [IdentityPartsSeparator](../../client-api/configuration/conventions#identitypartsseparator) convention.  

</Admonition>

## Manual HiLo ID generation

* **Automatic generation**:  
  When the session stores a new document with the `Id` set to `null`, RavenDB's default HiLo ID generator automatically generates the ID for the document.
  This document ID includes the collection name, a unique number, and the server node-tag, ensuring the ID is unique across the database.

* **Manual generation**:  
  We provide you with the option of manually retrieving the next ID from the HiLo range currently reserved for the client without having to store the document first.
  You can retrieve either the next number portion or the full document ID and then use it when storing the document, as explained below:  
    * [Get next ID - number only](../../client-api/document-identifiers/hilo-algorithm#get-next-id---number-only)
    * [Get next ID - full document ID](../../client-api/document-identifiers/hilo-algorithm#get-next-id---full-document-id)
### Get next ID - number only

You can take advantage of the HiLo algorithm and create documents with your own customized ID that is based on the next HiLo ID number provided by the client.

<Admonition type="warning" title="Warning">

* Manually getting the next HiLo ID number only provides **the next number in the HiLo range**,  
  it does Not include the collection name and the server node-tag. 
* Therefore, when manually specifying your own IDs this way,  
  you are responsible for ensuring that the IDs are unique within the database.

#### Syntax:

Either one of the following overloads will return the next available ID from the HiLo numbers reserved for the client. 
The returned ID number can then be used when storing a new document.

|--------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **database**       | `string` | The database for which to get the ID.
`null` will get the ID for the default database set in the document store.                        |
| **collectionName** | `string` | The collection for which to get the ID.                                                                                                     |
| **entity**         | `object` | An instance of the specified collection.                                                                                                    |

#### Example:

The following example shows how to get the next ID number from the HiLo range reserved for the client.  
The ID provided is the next unique number without the node tag and the collection.  
This ID is then used to create and store a new document.

Calling `GenerateNextIdForAsync` ensures minimal calls to the server,  
as the ID is generated by the client from the reserved range of numbers.

<TabItem value="something" label="manual_hilo_sample">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`using (var session = store.OpenSession())
\{
    // Use any overload to get the next id:
    // (Note how the id increases with each call)
    // ==========================================
    
    var nextId = await store.HiLoIdGenerator.GenerateNextIdForAsync(null, "Products");
    // nextId = 1
    
    nextId = await store.HiLoIdGenerator.GenerateNextIdForAsync(null, new Product());
    // nextId = 2
    
    nextId = await store.HiLoIdGenerator.GenerateNextIdForAsync(null, typeof(Product));
    // nextId = 3

    // Now you can create a new document with the nextId received
    // ==========================================================
    
    var product = new Product
    \{
        Id = "MyCustomId/" + nextId.ToString()
    \};
    
    // Store the new document
    // The document ID will be: "MyCustomId/3"  
    session.Store(product);
    session.SaveChanges();
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

##### Unique IDs across the cluster

This manual generator sample is sufficient if you are using only one server.  
If you want to ensure unique IDs across the cluster, we recommend using [our default HiLo generator](../../client-api/document-identifiers/working-with-document-identifiers#autogenerated-ids).  

You may also consider using the [cluster-wide Identities generator](../../client-api/document-identifiers/working-with-document-identifiers#identities), which guarantees a unique ID across the cluster.
It is more costly than the default HiLo generator because it requires a request from the server for _each ID_, 
and the server needs to do a Raft consensus check to ensure that the other nodes in the cluster agree that the ID is unique, then returns the ID to the client.

</Admonition>
### Get next ID - full document ID

You can request to get the next full document ID from the default HiLo generator without having to store the document first.

#### Syntax:

<TabItem value="something" label="manual_hilo_getFullId_syntax">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`Task<string> GenerateDocumentIdAsync(string database, object entity);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

#### Example:

The latest HiLo ID number generated in the example above was `3`.  
Therefore, when running the following example immediately after, 
the consecutive number `4` is retrieved and incorporated into the full document ID (`products/4-A`) that is returned by `GenerateDocumentIdAsync`.

<TabItem value="something" label="manual_hilo_getFullId">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`using (var session = store.OpenSession())
\{
    var nextFullId = await store.HiLoIdGenerator.GenerateDocumentIdAsync(null, "Products");
    // nextFullId = "products/4-A"

    // You can now use the nextFullId and customize the document ID as you wish:
    var product = new Product
    \{
        Id = "MyCustomId/" + nextFullId
    \};
    
    session.Store(product);
    session.SaveChanges();
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## Overriding the HiLo algorithm

* RavenDB's default HiLo generator is managed by the `HiLoIdGenerator` property in your _DocumentStore_ object.

* If needed, you can override this default ID generation behavior by setting the [AsyncDocumentIdGenerator](../../client-api/configuration/conventions#asyncdocumentidgenerator) convention with your own implementation.

* Once you configure your custom behavior through this convention:  

    * Your customized ID generation will be applied whenever you store a document without explicitly specifying an `Id`.
  
    * Attempting to call [GenerateNextIdForAsync](../../client-api/document-identifiers/hilo-algorithm#get-next-id---number-only) or 
      [GenerateDocumentIdAsync](../../client-api/document-identifiers/hilo-algorithm#get-next-id---full-document-id) via the store's `HiLoIdGenerator`   
      will throw an exception.
