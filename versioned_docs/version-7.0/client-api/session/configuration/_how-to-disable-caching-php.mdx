To reduce the overhead of sending the documents over the network, 
client library is caching the HTTP responses and sends only ETags to Server. 

If the request was previously cached giving the Server an opportunity to send back `304 Not Modified` 
without any content data or sending the up-to-date results, this will update the cache. 

This behavior can be changed globally by disabling the HTTP Cache size (more [here](../../../client-api/configuration/conventions.mdx#maxhttpcachesize)).  
It can also be changed per session, using the `setNoCaching` method.

## Example

<TabItem value="disable_caching" label="disable_caching">
<CodeBlock language="php">
{`$sessionOptions = new SessionOptions();
$sessionOptions->setNoCaching(true);

$session = $store->openSession($sessionOptions);
try \{
    // code here
\} finally \{
    $session->close();
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
