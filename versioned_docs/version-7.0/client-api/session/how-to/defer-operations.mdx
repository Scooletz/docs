* `Defer` allows you to register server commands via the session.

* All the deferred requests will be stored in the session and sent to the server in a single batch when SaveChanges is called,
  along with any other changes/operations made on the session.  
  Thus, all deferred commands are __executed as part of the session's SaveChanges transaction__.

## Defer commands example

<TabItem value="something" label="defer_1">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`// Defer is available in the session's Advanced methods 
session.Advanced.Defer(
    
    // Define commands to be executed:
    // i.e. Put a new document

            ["Name"] = "My Product",
            ["Supplier"] = "suppliers/1-A",
            ["@metadata"] = new DynamicJsonValue
            \{
                ["@collection"] = "Products"
            \}
        \}),
    
    // Patch document
    new PatchCommandData("products/999-A", null, new PatchRequest
            \{
                Script = "this.Supplier = 'suppliers/2-A';"
            \},
            null),
    
    // Force a revision to be created
    new ForceRevisionCommandData("products/999-A"),
    
    // Delete a document
    new DeleteCommandData("products/1-A", null)
);

// All deferred commands will be sent to the server upon calling SaveChanges
session.SaveChanges();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## Commands that can be deferred

The following commands implement the `ICommandData` interface and can be deferred:  

  - [PutCommandData](../../../glossary/put-command-data)
  - [DeleteCommandData](../../../glossary/delete-command-data)
  - DeletePrefixedCommandData
  - [PatchCommandData](../../../glossary/patch-command-data)
  - BatchPatchCommandData
  - PutAttachmentCommandData
  - DeleteAttachmentCommandData
  - [CopyAttachmentCommandData](../../../glossary/copy-attachment-command-data)
  - [MoveAttachmentCommandData](../../../glossary/move-attachment-command-data)
  - [CountersBatchCommandData](../../../glossary/counters-batch-command-data)
  - PutCompareExchangeCommandData
  - DeleteCompareExchangeCommandData
  - CopyTimeSeriesCommandData
  - TimeSeriesBatchCommandData
  - ForceRevisionCommandData


## Syntax

<TabItem value="something" label="syntax">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`void Defer(ICommandData command, params ICommandData[] commands);
void Defer(ICommandData[] commands);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| - |-|-|
| **command** | A command that implements the `ICommandData` interface | The command to be executed |
| **commands** | `ICommandData[]` | Array of commands to be executed |




</LanguageContent>
<LanguageContent language="java">


Commands can be deferred till `saveChanges` is called by using `defer` method in `advanced` session operations.  
All of the operations will update teh session state appropriately after `saveChanges` is called.

Types of commands that can be deferred:

- [PutCommandData](../../../glossary/put-command-data)
- [DeleteCommandData](../../../glossary/delete-command-data)
- DeletePrefixedCommandData
- [PatchCommandData](../../../glossary/patch-command-data)
- PutAttachmentCommandData
- DeleteAttachmentCommandData
- [CopyAttachmentCommandData](../../../glossary/copy-attachment-command-data)
- [MoveAttachmentCommandData](../../../glossary/move-attachment-command-data)
- [CountersBatchCommandData](../../../glossary/counters-batch-command-data)

## Syntax

<TabItem value="something-something" label="defer_1">
<CodeBlock language="java">
{`void defer(ICommandData command, ICommandData... commands);

void defer(ICommandData[] commands);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

| Parameters | | |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| `ICommandData` | Command to be executed. |
| `ICommandData[]` | Array of commands implementing `ICommandData` interface. |

## Example

<TabItem value="something-something" label="defer_2">
<CodeBlock language="java">
{`Map<String, Object> value1 = new HashMap<>();
value1.put("Name", "My Product");
value1.put("Supplier", "suppliers/999-A");
value1.put("@metadata", Collections.singletonMap("@collection", "Users"));

PutCommandDataWithJson putCommand1 =
    new PutCommandDataWithJson("products/999-A",
        null,
        store.getConventions().getEntityMapper().valueToTree(value1));

HashMap<String, Object> value2 = new HashMap<>();
value2.put("Name", "My Product");
value2.put("Supplier", "suppliers/999-A");
value2.put("@metadata", Collections.singletonMap("@collection", "Suppliers"));

PutCommandDataWithJson putCommand2 =
    new PutCommandDataWithJson("suppliers/999-A",
        null,
        store.getConventions().getEntityMapper().valueToTree(value2));

DeleteCommandData command3 = new DeleteCommandData("products/1-A", null);

session.advanced().defer(putCommand1, putCommand2, command3);
