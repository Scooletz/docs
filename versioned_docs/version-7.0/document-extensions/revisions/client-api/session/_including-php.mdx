## Overview

#### Why include revisions:

* Including revisions may be useful, for example, when an auditing application loads or queries for a document.  
  The document's past revisions can be included with the document to make the document's history available for instant inspection.  

* Once loaded to the session, there are no additional trips to the server when accessing the revisions.  
  [Getting](../../../../document-extensions/revisions/client-api/session/loading.mdx) a revision that was included with the document will retrieve it directly from the session.  
  This also holds true when attempting to include revisions but none are found.
#### Including by Creation Time:

* You can include a single revision by specifying its creation time, see examples below.

* You can pass local time or UTC, either way the server will  convert it to UTC.  

* **If the provided time matches** the creation time of a document revision, this revision will be included.

* **If no exact match is found**, then the first revision that precedes the specified time will be returned.
#### Including by Change Vector:

* Each time a document is modified, its [Change Vector](../../../../server/clustering/replication/change-vector.mdx) is updated.  

* When a revision is created,  
  the revision's change vector is the change vector of the document at the time of the revision's creation.  

* To include single or multiple document revisions by their change vectors:   

  * When modifying the document, store its updated change vector in a property in the document.  
    Can be done by [patching](../../../../document-extensions/revisions/client-api/session/including.mdx#patching-the-revision-change-vector) the document from the Client API or from the Studio.  
  
  * Specify the **path** to this property when including the revisions, see examples below.  
  
  * e.g.:  
    Each time an employee's contract document is modified (e.g. when their salary is raised),  
    you can add the current change vector of the document to a dedicated property in the document.  
    Whenever the time comes to re-evaluate an employee's terms and their contract is loaded,  
    its past revisions can be easily included with it by their change vectors.



## Include revisions when Loading document

#### Include a revision by Time:

<TabItem value="include_1" label="include_1">
<CodeBlock language="php">
{`// The revision creation time
// For example - looking for a revision from last month
$creationTime = (new DateTime())->sub(new DateInterval("P1M"));

// Load a document:
$order = $session->load(Order::class, "orders/1-A", function($builder) use ($creationTime) \{
        return $builder
            // Pass the revision creation time to 'IncludeRevisionsBefore'
            // The revision will be 'loaded' to the session along with the document
            ->includeRevisionsBefore($creationTime);
    \});

// Get the revision by creation time - it will be retrieved from the SESSION
// No additional trip to the server is made
$revision = $session
    ->advanced()->revisions()->get(Order::class, "orders/1-A", $creationTime);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
#### Include revisions by Change Vector:

<TabItem value="include_2" label="include_2">
<CodeBlock language="php">
{`// Load a document:
$contract = $session->load(Contract::class, "contracts/1-A", function($builder) \{
    return $builder

        // Pass the path to the document property that contains the revision change vector(s)
        // The revision(s) will be 'loaded' to the session along with the document
        ->includeRevisions("RevisionChangeVector")
        ->includeRevisions("RevisionChangeVectors");
\});

// Get the revision(s) by change vectors - it will be retrieved from the SESSION
// No additional trip to the server is made
$revision = $session->advanced()->revisions()->get(Contract::class, "RevisionChangeVector");
$revisions = $session->advanced()->revisions()->get(Contract::class, "RevisionChangeVectors");
`}
</CodeBlock>

## Include revisions when making a Query

#### Include revisions by Time:

<TabItem value="include_3" label="include_3">
<CodeBlock language="php">
{`// The revision creation time
// For example - looking for revisions from last month
$creationTime = (new DateTime())->sub(new DateInterval("P1M");

// Query for documents:
$orderDocuments = $session->query(Order::class)
    ->whereEquals("ShipTo.Country",  "Canada")
     // Pass the revision creation time to 'IncludeRevisionsBefore'
    ->include(function($builder) use ($creationTime) \{ return $builder->includeRevisionsBefore($creationTime); \})
     // For each document in the query results,
     // the matching revision will be 'loaded' to the session along with the document
    ->toList();

// Get a revision by its creation time for a document from the query results
// It will be retrieved from the SESSION - no additional trip to the server is made
$revision = $session
    ->advanced()->revisions()->getBeforeDate(Order::class, $orderDocuments[0]->getId(), $creationTime);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
#### Include revisions by Change Vector:

<TabItem value="include_4" label="include_4">
<CodeBlock language="php">
{`// Query for documents:
$orderDocuments = $session->query(Contract::class)
     // Pass the path to the document property that contains the revision change vector(s)
    ->include(function($builder) \{
         return $builder
             ->includeRevisions("getRevisionChangeVector")   // Include a single revision
             ->includeRevisions("getRevisionChangeVectors"); // Include multiple revisions
     \})
     // For each document in the query results,
     // the matching revisions will be 'loaded' to the session along with the document
    ->toList();

// Get the revision(s) by change vectors - it will be retrieved from the SESSION
// No additional trip to the server is made
$revision = $session
    ->advanced()->revisions()->get(Contract::class, $orderDocuments[0]->getRevisionChangeVector());
$revisions = $session
    ->advanced()->revisions()->get(Contract::class, $orderDocuments[0]->getRevisionChangeVectors());
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

* See the _Contract_ class definition [above](../../../../document-extensions/revisions/client-api/session/including.mdx#sample-document). 



## Include revisions when making a Raw Query

* Use `include revisions` in your RQL when making a raw query.   

* Pass either the revision creation time or the path to the document property containing the change vector(s),  
  RavenDB will figure out the parameter type passed and include the revisions accordingly.  

* Aliases (e.g. `from Users as U`) are Not supported by raw queries that include revisions.
#### Include revisions by Time:

<TabItem value="include_5" label="include_5">
<CodeBlock language="php">
{`// The revision creation time
// For example - looking for revisions from last month
$creationTime = (new DateTime())->sub(new DateInterval("P1M"));

// Query for documents with Raw Query:
$orderDocuments = $session->advanced()
     // Use 'include revisions' in the RQL
    ->rawQuery(Order::class, "from Orders include revisions(\\$p0)")
     // Pass the revision creation time
    ->addParameter("p0", $creationTime)
     // For each document in the query results,
     // the matching revision will be 'loaded' to the session along with the document
    ->toList();

// Get a revision by its creation time for a document from the query results

$revision = $session
    ->advanced()->revisions()->getBeforeDate(Order::class, $orderDocuments[0]->getId(), $creationTime);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
#### Include revisions by Change Vector:

<TabItem value="include_6" label="include_6">
<CodeBlock language="php">
{`// Query for documents with Raw Query:
$orderDocuments = $session->advanced()
     // Use 'include revisions' in the RQL
    ->rawQuery(Contract::class, "from Contracts include revisions(\\$p0, \\$p1)")
     // Pass the path to the document properties containing the change vectors

// No additional trip to the server is made
$revision = $session
    ->advanced()->revisions()->get(Contract::class, $orderDocuments[0]->getRevisionChangeVector());
$revisions = $session
    ->advanced()->revisions()->get(Contract::class, $orderDocuments[0]->getRevisionChangeVectors());
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

## Syntax

<TabItem value="syntax" label="syntax">
<CodeBlock language="php">
{`// Include a single revision by Time
public function includeRevisionsBefore(DateTime $before): IncludeBuilderInterface;

// Include a single revision by Change Vector path(s)
public function includeRevisions(string $changeVectorPaths): IncludeBuilderInterface;
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

| Parameters | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| **before** | `DateTime` | &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creation time of the revision to be included.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pass local time or UTC.<br/>The server will convert the param to UTC.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If no revision was created at this time then the first revision that precedes it is returned.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; |
| **changeVectorPaths** | `string` | &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The path to the document property that contains<br/> **an array of change vectors** of the revisions to be included.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; |



## Patching the revision change vector

* To include revisions when making a query or a raw query,  
  you need to specify the path to the document property that contains the revision change vector(s).  

* The below example shows how to get and patch a revision change vector to a document property.  

<TabItem value="include_7" label="include_7">
<CodeBlock language="php">
{`$session = $store->openSession();
try \{
    // Get the revisions' metadata for document 'contracts/1-A'
    /** @var array<MetadataAsDictionary> $contractRevisionsMetadata */
    $contractRevisionsMetadata =
        $session->advanced()->revisions()->getMetadataFor("contracts/1-A");

    // Get a change vector from the metadata
    $changeVector = $contractRevisionsMetadata[array_key_first($contractRevisionsMetadata)]->getString(DocumentsMetadata::CHANGE_VECTOR);

    // Patch the document - add the revision change vector to a specific document property
    $session->advanced()
        ->patch( "contracts/1-A", "RevisionChangeVector", $changeVector);

    // Save your changes
    $session->saveChanges();
\} finally \{
    $session->close();
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
