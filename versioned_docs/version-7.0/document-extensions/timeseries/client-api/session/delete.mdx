# Delete Time Series
<LanguageSwitcher supportedLanguages={supportedLanguages} />

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

* Use `TimeSeriesFor.Delete` for the following actions:
    * **Delete a single time series entry**
    * **Delete a range of entries**
    * **Delete the whole time series**:  
      To remove the whole time series simply delete all its entries.

    * [`Delete` usage](../../../../document-extensions/timeseries/client-api/session/delete.mdx#delete-usage)
    * [Examples](../../../../document-extensions/timeseries/client-api/session/delete.mdx#examples)
      * [Delete single entry](../../../../document-extensions/timeseries/client-api/session/delete.mdx#delete-single-entry)
      * [Delete range of entries](../../../../document-extensions/timeseries/client-api/session/delete.mdx#delete-range-of-entries)

## `Delete` usage

**Flow**:

* Open a session.  
* Create an instance of `TimeSeriesFor` and pass it the following:
    * Provide an explicit document ID, or -   
      pass an [entity tracked by the session](../../../../client-api/session/what-is-a-session-and-how-does-it-work.mdx#unit-of-work-pattern),
      e.g. a document object returned from [session.Query](../../../../client-api/session/querying/how-to-query.mdx) or from [session.Load](../../../../client-api/session/loading-entities.mdx#load).
    * Specify the time series name.
* Call `TimeSeriesFor.Delete`:
    * Provide a single timestamp to delete a specific entry, or -  
    * Specify a range of timestamps to delete multiple entries.
* Call `session.SaveChanges` for the action to take effect on the server.  

**Note**:

* If the specified document doesn't exist, a `DocumentDoesNotExistException` is thrown.
* Attempting to delete nonexistent entries results in a no-op and generates no exception.
* To delete the whole time series simply delete all its entries.  
  The series is removed when all its entries are deleted.
* Deleting a document deletes all its time series as well.



## Examples

In the following examples we delete time series entries appended by sample code in the 
[Append](../../../../document-extensions/timeseries/client-api/session/append.mdx) article.  
#### Delete single entry:

<TabItem value="timeseries_region_Delete-TimeSeriesFor-Single-Time-Point" label="timeseries_region_Delete-TimeSeriesFor-Single-Time-Point">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`// Delete a single entry
using (var session = store.OpenSession())
\{
    session.TimeSeriesFor("users/john", "HeartRates")
        .Delete(baseline.AddMinutes(1));

    session.SaveChanges();
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
#### Delete range of entries:

<TabItem value="timeseries_region_TimeSeriesFor-Delete-Time-Points-Range" label="timeseries_region_TimeSeriesFor-Delete-Time-Points-Range">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`// Delete a range of entries from the time series
using (var session = store.OpenSession())
\{
    session.TimeSeriesFor("users/john", "HeartRates")
        .Delete(baseline.AddSeconds(0), baseline.AddSeconds(9));

    session.SaveChanges();
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

#### Delete time series:

<TabItem value="delete_3" label="delete_3">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`// Get an instance of 'timeSeriesFor'
const tsf = session.timeSeriesFor("users/john", "HeartRates");
