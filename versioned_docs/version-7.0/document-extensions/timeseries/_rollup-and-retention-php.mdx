Many time series applications produce massive amounts of data at a steady rate.  
**Time Series Policies** help you manage your data in two ways:  

* Creating **Rollups**:  
  Summarizing time series data by aggregating it into the form of a new, lower-resolution time series.

* Limiting **Retention**:  
  Controlling the duration for which time series data is kept before deletion.

## Time series policies

#### What are rollups?

A rollup is a time series that summarizes the data from another time series, 
with each rollup entry representing a specific time frame in the original time series.  
Each rollup entry contains 6 values that aggregate the data from all the entries in the original time frame:  

* `First` - the value of the first entry in the frame.  
* `Last` - the value of the last entry.  
* `Min` - the smallest value.  
* `Max` - the largest value.  
* `Sum` - the sum of all the values in the frame.  
* `Count` - the total number of entries in the frame.  

This results in a much more compact time series that still contains useful information about the original time series (also called "raw" time series).

#### Rollup policies:

Rollup time series are created automatically according to rollup policies that can be defined from Studio or client code.  

* A rollup policy applies to all time series of every document in the given collection. 

* Each collection can be configured to have multiple policies which are applied sequentially:
  * The raw time series is first rolled up using the policy with the shortest aggregation frame.
  * Subsequently, the resulting rollup time series is further aggregated using the policy with the next shortest aggregation frame,  
    and so on.

[Querying with group-by](../../document-extensions/timeseries/querying/aggregation-and-projections.mdx#examples) 
will transparently traverse over the rollups to retrieve the relevant results.  

Let's look at an example of rollup data:  

!["Rollup time series entries"](./assets/rollup-1.png)

**1) Name:**  
The name of a rollup time series has this format: `<name of raw time series>@<name of time series policy>`  
It is a combination of the name of the raw time series and the name of the time series policy separated by `@`.  
In the image above these are "HeartRates" and "byHour" respectively.  
For this reason, neither a time series name nor a policy name can have the character `@` in it.

**2) Timestamp:**  
The aggregation frame always begins at a round number of one of these time units: a second, minute, hour, day, week, month, or year. 
So the frame includes all entries starting at a round number of time units, and ending at a round number *minus one millisecond* 
(since milliseconds are the minimal resolution in RavenDB time series). 
The timestamp for a rollup entry is the beginning of the frame it represents.  

For example, if the aggregation frame is three days, a frame will start and end at a time stamps like:  
`2020-01-01 00:00:00` - `2020-01-03 23:59:59.999`.

**3) Values:**  
Each group of six values represents one value from the original entries. 
If the raw time series has `n` values per entry, the rollup time series will have `6 * n` per entry: 
the first six summarize the first raw value, the next six summarize the next raw value, and so on. 
The aggregated values have the names: `"First (<name of raw value>)", "Last (<name of raw value>)", ...` respectively.  

Because time series entries are limited to 32 values, rollups are limited to the first five values of an original time series entry, or 30 aggregate values.  



## Examples

#### Create time series policies:

<TabItem value="rollup_and_retention_0" label="rollup_and_retention_0">
<CodeBlock language="php">
{`$oneWeek = TimeValue::ofDays(7);
$fiveYears = TimeValue::ofYears(5);

// Define a policy on the RAW time series data:
// ============================================
$rawPolicy = new RawTimeSeriesPolicy($fiveYears); // Retain entries for five years

// Define a ROLLUP policy:
// =======================
$rollupPolicy = new TimeSeriesPolicy(
        "By1WeekFor1Year", // Name of policy
        $oneWeek, // Aggregation time, roll-up the data for each week
        $fiveYears); // Retention time, keep data for five years

// Define the time series configuration for collection "Companies" (use above policies):
// =====================================================================================
$companyConfig = new TimeSeriesCollectionConfiguration();
$companyConfig->setPolicies(TimeSeriesPolicyArray::fromArray([ $rollupPolicy ]));
$companyConfig->setRawPolicy($rawPolicy);

$timeSeriesConfig = new TimeSeriesConfiguration();
$timeSeriesConfig->setCollections([
    "Companies" => $companyConfig
]);

// Deploy the time series configuration to the server
// by sending the 'ConfigureTimeSeriesOperation' operation:
// ========================================================
$store->maintenance()->send(new ConfigureTimeSeriesOperation($timeSeriesConfig));

// NOTE:
// The time series entries in the RavenDB sample data are dated up to the year 2020.
// To ensure that you see the rollup time series created when running this example,
// the retention time should be set to exceed that year.
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
#### Retrieve rollup data:

* Retrieving entries from a rollup time series is similar to getting the raw time series data.

* Learn more about using `timeSeriesFor.get` in [Get time series entries](../../document-extensions/timeseries/client-api/session/get/get-entries.mdx).

<TabItem value="rollup_and_retention_1" label="rollup_and_retention_1">
<CodeBlock language="php">
{`// Get all data from the RAW time series:
// ======================================

$rawData = $session
    ->timeSeriesFor("companies/91-A", "StockPrices")
    ->get();

// Get all data from the ROLLUP time series:
// =========================================

// Either - pass the rollup name explicitly to 'TimeSeriesFor':
$rollupData = $session
    ->timeSeriesFor("companies/91-A", "StockPrices@By1WeekFor1Year")
    ->get();

// Or - get the rollup name by calling 'GetTimeSeriesName':
$rollupData = $session
    ->timeSeriesFor("companies/91-A", $rollupPolicy->GetTimeSeriesName("StockPrices"))
    ->get();

// The raw time series has 100 entries
$this->assertCount(100, $rawData);
$this->assertFalse($rawData[0]->isRollup());

// The rollup time series has only 22 entries
// as each entry aggregates 1 week's data from the raw time series
$this->assertCount(22, $rollupData);
$this->assertTrue($rollupData[0]->isRollup());
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## Syntax

### The time series policies

* `rawPolicy`  
  * Used to define the retention time of the raw time series. 
  * Only one such policy per collection can be defined.
  * Does not perform aggregation.

* Rollup policy:  
  * Used to define the aggregation time frame and retention time for the rollup time series.
  * Multiple policies can be defined per collection.
