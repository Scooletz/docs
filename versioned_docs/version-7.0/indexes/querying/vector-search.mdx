* Vector search enables you to retrieve data based on **contextual relevance**, rather than relying on exact keyword matches.
 
* In addition to its other capabilities, RavenDB serves as a **vector database** that allows you to efficiently store, index, and search vector representations.
  
* You can perform vector searches to locate documents based on their **content's similarity** to a given search item in your queries.

* This feature is covered in detail in the following articles:

    * [RavenDB as a Vector Database](../../ai-integration/vector-search/ravendb-as-vector-database.mdx)
    * [Vector Search using a Dynamic Query](../../ai-integration/vector-search/vector-search-using-dynamic-query.mdx)
    * [Vector Search using a Static Index](../../ai-integration/vector-search/vector-search-using-static-index.mdx)
