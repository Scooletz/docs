* **Map-Reduce indexes** allow complex ***data aggregation*** that can be queried on 
  with very little cost, regardless of the data size.  

* To expedite queries and prevent performance degradation during queries, the aggregation 
  is done during the indexing phase, _not_ at query time.  

* Once new data enters the database, or existing documents are modified,  
  the Map-Reduce index will re-calculate the aggregated data so that the 
  aggregation results are always available and up-to-date.  

* The aggregation computation is done in two separate consecutive actions: the `Map` and the `Reduce`.  
  * **The Map stage:**  
    This first stage runs the defined Map function(s) on each document, indexing the specified fields.  
  * **The Reduce stage:**  
    This second stage groups the specified requested fields that were indexed in the Map stage,  
    and then runs the Reduce function to get a final aggregation result per field value.

## Creating Map Reduce Indexes

When it comes to index creation, the only difference between simple indexes and the map-reduce ones 
is an additional reduce function defined in the index definition.  
To deploy an index we need to create a definition and deploy it using one of the ways described in the 
[creating and deploying](../indexes/creating-and-deploying.mdx) article.  
### Example I - Count

Let's assume that we want to count the number of products for each category.  
To do it, we can create the following index using `LoadDocument` inside:  
<TabItem value="map_reduce_0_0" label="map_reduce_0_0">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`class Products_ByCategory extends AbstractCsharpIndexCreationTask \{

    constructor() \{
        super();

        this.map = "docs.Products.Select(product => new \{ " +
            "    Product = product, " +
            "    CategoryName = (this.LoadDocument(product.Category, \\"Categories\\")).Name " +
            "\}).Select(this0 => new \{ " +
            "    Category = this0.CategoryName, " +
            "    Count = 1 " +
            "\})";

        this.reduce = "results.GroupBy(result => result.category).Select(g => new \{ " +
            "    category = g.Key, " +
            "    count = Enumerable.Sum(g, x => ((int) x.count)) " +
            "\})";
    \}
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

and issue the query:  
<Tabs groupId='languageSyntax'>
<TabItem value="Query" label="Query">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`const results = await session
    .query({ indexName: "Products/ByCategory" })
    .whereEquals("Category", "Seafood")
    .all();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="RQL" label="RQL">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`from 'Products/ByCategory'
where Category == 'Seafood'
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The above query will return one result for _Seafood_ with the appropriate number of products from that category.  

### Example II - Average

In this example, we will count an average product price for each category.  
The index definition:  
<TabItem value="map_reduce_1_0" label="map_reduce_1_0">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`class Products_Average_ByCategory extends AbstractCsharpIndexCreationTask \{

    constructor() \{
        super();

        this.map = "docs.Products.Select(product => new \{ " +
            "    Product = product, " +
            "    CategoryName = (this.LoadDocument(product.Category, \\"Categories\\")).Name " +
            "\}).Select(this0 => new \{ " +
            "    Category = this0.CategoryName, " +
            "    PriceSum = this0.product.PricePerUnit, " +
            "    PriceAverage = 0, " +
            "    ProductCount = 1 " +
            "\})";

        this.reduce = "results.GroupBy(result => result.Category).Select(g => new \{ " +
            "    g = g, " +
            "    ProductCount = Enumerable.Sum(g, x => ((int) x.ProductCount)) " +
            "\}).Select(this0 => new \{ " +
            "    this0 = this0, " +
            "    PriceSum = Enumerable.Sum(this0.g, x0 => ((decimal) x0.PriceSum)) " +
            "\}).Select(this1 => new \{ " +
            "    Category = this1.this0.g.Key, " +
            "    PriceSum = this1.PriceSum, " +
            "    PriceAverage = this1.PriceSum / ((decimal) this1.this0.ProductCount), " +
            "    ProductCount = this1.this0.ProductCount " +
            "\})";
    \}
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

and the query:  
<Tabs groupId='languageSyntax'>
<TabItem value="Query" label="Query">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`const results = await session
    .query({ indexName: "Products_Average_ByCategory" })
    .whereEquals("Category", "Seafood")
    .all();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="RQL" label="RQL">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`from 'Products/Average/ByCategory'
where Category == 'Seafood'
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Example III - Calculations

This example illustrates how we can put some calculations inside an index using  
on one of the indexes available in the sample database (`Product/Sales`).  

We want to know how many times each product was ordered and how much we earned for it.  
In order to extract that information, we need to define the following index:  
<TabItem value="map_reduce_2_0" label="map_reduce_2_0">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`class Product_Sales extends AbstractCsharpIndexCreationTask \{
    constructor() \{
        super();

        this.map = "docs.Orders.SelectMany(order => order.Lines, (order, line) => new \{ " +
            "    Product = line.Product, " +
            "    Count = 1, " +
            "    Total = (((decimal) line.Quantity) * line.PricePerUnit) * (1M - line.Discount) " +
            "\})";


        this.reduce = "results.GroupBy(result => result.Product).Select(g => new \{ " +
            "    Product = g.Key, " +
            "    Count = Enumerable.Sum(g, x => ((int) x.Count)), " +
            "    Total = Enumerable.Sum(g, x0 => ((decimal) x0.Total)) " +
            "\})";
    \}
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

and send the query:  
<Tabs groupId='languageSyntax'>
<TabItem value="Query" label="Query">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`const results = await session
    .query({ indexName: "Product/Sales" })
    .all();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="RQL" label="RQL">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`from 'Product/Sales'
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>



## Reduce Results as Artificial Documents

#### Map-Reduce Output Documents

In addition to storing the aggregation results in the index, the map-reduce index can also output 
those reduce results as documents to a specified collection. In order to create these documents, 
called _"artificial",_ you need to define the target collection using the `outputReduceToCollection` 
property in the index definition.  

Writing map-reduce outputs into documents allows you to define additional indexes on top of them 
that give you the option to create recursive map-reduce operations. This makes it cheap and easy 
to, for example, recursively create daily, monthly, and yearly summaries on the same data.  

In addition, you can also apply the usual operations on artificial documents (e.g. data 
subscriptions or ETL).  

If the aggregation value for a given reduce key changes, we overwrite the output document. If the 
given reduce key no longer has a result, the output document will be removed.  

#### Reference Documents

To help organize these output documents, the map-reduce index can also create an additional 
collection of artificial _reference documents_. These documents aggregate the output documents 
and store their document IDs in an array field `ReduceOutputs`.  

The document IDs of reference documents are customized to follow some pattern. The format you 
give to their document ID also determines how the output documents are grouped.  

Because reference documents have well known, predictable IDs, they are easier to plug into 
indexes and other operations, and can serve as an intermediary for the output documents whose 
IDs are less predictable. This allows you to chain map-reduce indexes in a recursive fashion, 
see [Example II](../indexes/map-reduce-indexes.mdx#example-ii).  

Learn more about how to configure output and reference documents in the 
[Studio: Create Map-Reduce Index](../studio/database/indexes/create-map-reduce-index.mdx).  
### Artificial Document IDs

The identifiers of artificial documents are generated as:

- `<OutputCollectionName>/<hash-of-reduce-key>`

For the above sample index, the document ID can be:

- `MonthlyProductSales/13770576973199715021`

The numeric part is the hash of the reduce key values, in this case: `hash(Product, Month)`.

If the aggregation value for a given reduce key changes then we overwrite the artificial document. It will get removed once there is no result for a given reduce key.
    
### Artificial Document Flags

Documents generated by map-reduce indexes get the following `@flags` metadata:

<TabItem value="json" label="json">
<CodeBlock language="json">
{`"@flags": "Artificial, FromIndex"
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

Those flags are used internally by the database to filter out artificial documents during replication.

### Usage

The map-reduce output documents are configured with these properties of 
`IndexDefinition`:  

<TabItem value="syntax_0" label="syntax_0">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`const outputReduceToCollection = indexDefinition.outputReduceToCollection;

const patternReferencesCollectionName = indexDefinition.patternReferencesCollectionName;

const patternForOutputReduceToCollectionReferences = indexDefinition.patternForOutputReduceToCollectionReferences;
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

| Parameters | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| **outputReduceToCollection** | `string` | Collection name for the output documents. |
| **patternReferencesCollectionName** | `string` | Optional collection name for the reference documents - by default it is `<outputReduceToCollection>/References`. |
| **patternForOutputReduceToCollectionReferences** | `string` | Document ID format for reference documents. This ID references the fields of the reduce function output, which determines how the output documents are aggregated. The type of this parameter is different depending on if the index is created using [IndexDefinition](../client-api/operations/maintenance/indexes/put-indexes.mdx#put-indexes-operation) or [AbstractJavaScriptIndexCreationTask](../indexes/creating-and-deploying.mdx#define-a-static-index-using-a-custom-class). |

### Examples

<TabItem value="map_reduce_3_0" label="map_reduce_3_0">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`class Product_Sales_ByMonth extends AbstractCsharpIndexCreationTask \{
    constructor() \{
        super();

        this.map = "docs.Orders.SelectMany(order => order.Lines, (order, line) => new \{ " +
            "    Product = line.Product, " +
            "    Month = new DateTime(order.OrderedAt.Year, order.OrderedAt.Month, 1), " +
            "    Count = 1, " +
            "    Total = (((decimal) line.Quantity) * line.PricePerUnit) * (1M - line.Discount) " +
            "\})";

        this.reduce = "results.GroupBy(result => new \{ " +
            "    Product = result.Product, " +
            "    Month = result.Month " +
            "\}).Select(g => new \{ " +
            "    Product = g.Key.Product, " +
            "    Month = g.Key.Month, " +
            "    Count = Enumerable.Sum(g, x => ((int) x.Count)), " +
            "    Total = Enumerable.Sum(g, x0 => ((decimal) x0.Total)) " +
            "\})";

        this.outputReduceToCollection = "MonthlyProductSales";
    \}
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## Important Comments

## Saving documents
[Artificial documents](../indexes/map-reduce-indexes.mdx#reduce-results-as-artificial-documents) 
are stored immediately after the indexing transaction completes.  

## Recursive indexing loop
It is **forbidden** to output reduce results to collections such as the following:  

- A collection that the current index is already working on.  
  E.g., an index on a `DailyInvoices` collection outputs to `DailyInvoices`.  
- A collection that the current index is loading a document from.  
  E.g., an index with `LoadDocument(id, "Invoices")` outputs to `Invoices`.  
- Two collections, each processed by a map-reduce indexes,  
  when each index outputs to the second collection.  
  E.g.,  
  An index on the `Invoices` collection outputs to the `DailyInvoices` collection,  
  while an index on `DailyInvoices` outputs to `Invoices`.  

When an attempt to create such an infinite indexing loop is 
detected a detailed error is generated.  

## Output to an Existing collection
Creating a map-reduce index which defines an output collection that already 
exists and contains documents, will result in an error.  
Delete all documents from the target collection before creating the index, 
or output results to a different collection.  

## Modification of Artificial Documents
Artificial documents can be loaded and queried just like regular documents.  
However, it is **not** recommended to edit artificial documents manually since 
any index results update would overwrite all manual modifications made in them.  

## Map-Reduce Indexes on a Sharded Database
On a [sharded database](../sharding/overview.mdx), the behavior of map-reduce 
indexes is altered in in a few ways that database operators should be aware of.  

* Read [here](../sharding/indexing.mdx#map-reduce-indexes-on-a-sharded-database) 
  about map-reduce indexes on a sharded database.  
* Read [here](../sharding/querying.mdx#querying-map-reduce-indexes) about querying 
  map-reduce indexes on a sharded database.
