   Select the database whose ongoing tasks you want to monitor.  
   Data for this database's ongoing tasks will be collected and presented in the graph.  

3. **Filter**  
   Filter the displayed tasks by the task's name (Subscription, RavenDB ETL, SQL ETL, OLAP ETL) 
   or by the target URL (External Replication).  

4. **Export**  
   The currently viewed graph data can be exported to a *.json file.  

5. **Import**  
   Import file to view a previously exported graph data.  
   No new data is collected & displayed when showing imported data.  



## Stats Graph

![Ongoing Tasks Stats Graph](./assets/stats-view-02-rulers-and-bars.png)

* The graph is added to the view once data is collected from at least one of the monitored tasks.  



## The Timeline Ruler

![The Timeline Ruler](./assets/stats-view-03-selection-and-clear-buttons.png)

1. **Selected Time Frame**  
   Select any timeline segment to explore the displayed tasks' activities during this time frame.  
   Click & drag or resize this frame to select different time frames for which the data will be shown in the graph.  
2. **Timeline Ruler Line**  
   The timeline ruler `Line` depicts the activity for all tasks presented in the graph.  
3. **Timeline Grid**  
   A grid of timestamp-labled vertical time lines provides points of reference by which 
   time frames can be selected.  
4. **Clear Selection**  
   Click to clear the selected frame.  
5. **Clear Graph**  
   Click to clear all the collected data from the graph.  
   <Admonition type="info" title="Info">
   Recently collected statistics are kept by RavenDB in memory, allowing you to 
   refresh the stats view without losing its entire history.  
   Using the `Clear Graph` button will clear all historical data.  
   </Admonition>
![Tail Stream End](./assets/stats-view-04-monitor-tail.png)

* 6. **Monitoring (tail -f)**  
  When this option is checked, the selected time frame will be continuously reallocated at the end of the data stream.  



## Task Rulers

Each monitored task has its dedicated ruler that displays the task's activities 
during the time specified by the timeline ruler above.  

### Task Ruler Closed View

### Task Rulers Time Grid

A grid of vertical time lines allows you to easily relate task events to their time of occurence.  

<Admonition type="info" title="Info">
Note that the [stats graph](../../../../studio/database/stats/ongoing-tasks-stats/overview.mdx#stats-graph) 
displays **two different time grids**.  

* The [Timeline ruler time grid](../../../../studio/database/stats/ongoing-tasks-stats/overview.mdx#the-timeline-ruler) 
  shows time points across the entire timeline ruler line.  
* The Task rulers time grid, discussed here, shows points of time 
  **within the selected time frame**.  
</Admonition>

![Task Rulers Time Grid](./assets/stats-view-task-rulers-time-grid.png)

1. **Grid Line Timestamp**  
   Time-grid lines are labled with timestamps.  
2. **Grid Line**  
   Time grid lines are displayed as *vertical dotted lines*.  
3. **Gap Line**  
   Gap lines, displayed as *vertical continuous lines*, indicate the renewal 
   of task activity after a period in which all tasks were idle.  
    * Hover over the gap line to show a tooltip that details the idle period 
      start time and duration.  
### Active and Inactive Display

**Active** tasks (e.g. a subscription task that a client is currently connected to) 
and **Inactive** tasks are shown in different styles.  

* An active task:
