# Ongoing Tasks - Overview
<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

* Ongoing tasks are **work tasks** defined for the database.
 
* Each task is assigned a responsible node from the [Database Group nodes](../../../../studio/database/settings/manage-database-group.mdx) to handle the work.  
    * If not specified by the user, the cluster decides which node will be responsible for the task. See [Members Duties](../../../../studio/database/settings/manage-database-group.mdx#database-group-topology---members-duties).  
    * If a node is down, the cluster will reassign the work to another node for the duration.  

* Once enabled, an **ongoing task** runs in the background,  
  and its responsible node executes the defined task work whenever relevant data changes occur.

**Replication:**

* **[External Replication](../../../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/external-replication-task.mdx)**  
    Create a live replica of your database in another RavenDB database in another cluster.  
    This replication is initiated by the source database.  
* **[Hub/Sink Replication](../../../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/hub-sink-replication/overview.mdx)**  
    Create a live replica of your database, or a part of it, in another RavenDB database.  
    The replication is initiated by the *Sink* task.  
    The replication can be *bidirectional* or limited to a *single direction*.  
    The replication can be *filtered* to allow the delivery of selected documents.  

**Backups & Subscriptions:**

* **[Backup](../../../../studio/database/tasks/backup-task.mdx)**  
    Schedule a backup or a snapshot of the database at a specified point in time.  
* **[Subscription](../../../../client-api/data-subscriptions/what-are-data-subscriptions.mdx)**  
    Send batches of documents that match a pre-defined query for processing on a client.

**ETL (RavenDB =&gt; Target):**

* **[RavenDB ETL](../../../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/ravendb-etl-task.mdx)**  
    Write all or chosen database documents to another RavenDB database.  
    Data can be filtered and modified with transformation scripts.  
* **[SQL ETL](../../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/sql.mdx)**  
    Write the database data to a relational database.  
    Data can be filtered and modified with transformation scripts.  
* **[OLAP ETL](../../../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/olap-etl-task.mdx)**  
    Convert database data to the _Parquet_ file format for OLAP purposes.  
    Data can be filtered and modified with transformation scripts.  
* **[Elasticsearch ETL](../../../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/elasticsearch-etl-task.mdx)**  
    Write all or chosen database documents to an Elasticsearch destination.  
    Data can be filtered and modified with transformation scripts.  
* **[Kafka ETL](../../../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/kafka-etl-task.mdx)**  
    Write all or chosen database documents to topics of a Kafka broker.  
    Data can be filtered and modified with transformation scripts.  
* **[RabbitMQ ETL](../../../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/rabbitmq-etl-task.mdx)**  
    Write all or chosen database documents to a RabbitMQ exchange.  
    Data can be filtered and modified with transformation scripts.  
* **[Azure Queue Storage ETL](../../../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/azure-queue-storage-etl.mdx)**  
    Write all or chosen database documents to Azure Queue Storage.  
    Data can be filtered and modified with transformation scripts.  

**Sink (Source =&gt; RavendB)**

* **[Kafka Sink](../../../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/kafka-queue-sink.mdx)**  
    Consume and process incoming messages from Kafka topics.  
    Add scripts to Load, Put, or Delete documents in RavenDB based on the incoming messages.  
* **[RabbitMQ Sink](../../../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/rabbitmq-queue-sink.mdx)**  
    Consume and process incoming messages from RabbitMQ queues.  
    Add scripts to Load, Put, or Delete documents in RavenDB based on the incoming messages.
