# Elasticsearch ETL Task
<Admonition type="note" title="">

* An **Elasticsearch ETL Task** creates an ETL process that transfers data 
  from selected RavenDB collections to an Elasticsearch destination.  
  The transferred data can be filtered and modified by transformation scripts.  
* An Elasticsearch ETL task transfers **documents only**.  
  Document extensions like attachments, counters, or time series, will not be transferred.  
* This page explains how to create an Elasticsearch ETL task using the Studio.  
  Learn more about Elasticsearch ETL tasks and how to create one using 
  the client API in [Ongoing Tasks: Elasticsearch ETL](../../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/elasticsearch.mdx)

## Navigate to the Elasticsearch ETL Task View

To begin creating your Elasticsearch ETL task:  

!["Ongoing tasks view"](./assets/ongoing-tasks-view.png)

!["Task selection view"](./assets/elasticsearch-etl-task-selection-view.png)



## Define the Elasticsearch ETL Task

!["Define Elasticsearch ETL task"](./assets/elasticsearch-etl-define-task.png)

1. **Task Name** (Optional)  
   * Enter a name for your task  
   * If no name is provided, the server will create a name based on the defined connection string,  
     e.g. *ElasticSearch ETL to ElasticConStr*  

2. **Task State**  
   Select the task state:  
   Enabled - The task runs in the background, transforming and sending documents as defined in this view.  
   Disabled - No documents are transformed and sent.  

3. **Responsible Node** (Optional)  
  * Select a node from the [Database Group](../../../../studio/database/settings/manage-database-group.mdx) to be responsible for this task.  
  * If no node is selected, the cluster will assign a responsible node (see [Members Duties](../../../../studio/database/settings/manage-database-group.mdx#database-group-topology---members-duties)).  

4. **Connection String**  
    * Select an existing connection string from the list or create a new one.  
    * The connection string defines the destination Elasticsearch URLs and the 
      authentication method.  
      !["Create Connection String"](./assets/elasticsearch-connection-string.png)
        * a. **Name** - Enter a name for the connection string.  
        * b. **Nodes URLs** - Provide the URL(s) of the destination Elasticsearch node(s).  
        * c. **Authentication** - Select the authentication method relevant for the 
          Elasticsearch node(s)
          !["Authentication Methods"](./assets/elasticsearch-connection-string-authentication.png)



## Elasticsearch Indexes

Elasticsearch uses [Indexes](https://www.elastic.co/blog/what-is-an-elasticsearch-index) to store, access, and delete documents.  
Use the task's **Elasticsearch Indexes** settings to determine which Elastsicsearch 
Indexes the ETL task will access.  

!["Define Elasticsearch Index"](./assets/elasticsearch-indexes-define-index.png)

#### 1. Add Index

* Click to add an Elasticsearch index to the list.  

#### 2. Index Name

* Enter the Elasticsearch index name.  
  The index name must match the index name provided in the 
  [loadTo\\\&lt;indexName\\\&gt;](../../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/basics.mdx#transform) command 
  in the transformation script.  
  E.g., using the command `loadToOrders` in the transformation script requires you 
  to define here an index by the name of `orders`.  
* The index name entered here must be all lower case, as required by Elasticsearch.  
  E.g. `orders`
* The index name used in the transformation script command can be either lower 
  or upper-case.  
  E.g. both `loadToOrders` and `loadToorders` are permitted.  

#### 3. Document ID Property Name

* Enter the name of the transformation script property that contains `id(this)`.  
  This property will be created in each generated Elasticsearch document, and 
  allow the ETL task to recognize the documents by their original RavenDB IDs 
  when they are hosted in Elasticsearch.  

* E.g. -  
   * The transformation script property: `OrderId: id(this)`  
   * The property name you enter as **Document ID Property Name**: `OrderId`  
   * In each document that the transformation script creates in Elasticsearch, 
     it will create a property named `OrderId`, that contains the original 
     RavenDB document ID.  

#### 4. Insert Only

* By default, the ETL task will:  
  1. **Delete** from the Elasticsearch destination all documents that 
     match the provided document ID field.  
     To do that, the ETL task will send the Elasticsearch destination 
     a `_delete_by_query` command.  
  2. **Append** new documents.  
     To do that, the ETL task will send the Elasticsearch destination 
     a `_bulk` command.  

* Check **Insert Only** to **skip the first step** and append new documents **without** 
  deleting existing ones first.  
  <Admonition type="warning" title="">
   Enabling **Insert Only** would accumulate new document versions on 
   your Elasticsearch destination without ever removing them.  
  </Admonition>

#### 5. Confirm

* Click to add this index to the list.  

#### 6. Cancel

* Click to cancel the operation without adding the index to the list.  

#### 7. An index that was added

* Can be edited or deleted.  



## Transformation Script

The transformation script defines the JSON document that will be sent to the 
Elasticsearch destination per RavenDB document from the selected collections.  

### Add Transformation Script

!["List of transformation Scripts"](./assets/elasticsearch-transformation-scripts-list.png)

1. **Add Transformation Script**  
   Click to add a new transformation script to the list.  

2. **Existing Script**  
     a. **Script** name & **Collections** on which it is defined. (Informative)  
     b. **Edit** - Click to edit the script.  
     c. **Remove** - Click to remove the script from the list.  
### Edit Transformation Script

!["Edit Transformation Script"](./assets/elasticsearch-edit-transformation-script.png)

1. **Script Name**  
   Enter a name for the script (Optional).  
   A default name will be generated if no name is entered, e.g. Script_1  

2. **Script**  
   Edit the transformation script.  
   * Define a **document object** whose contents will be extracted from 
     each RavenDB document processed by the ETL task and appended as 
     a document to the Elasticsearch destination.  
     E.g., `var orderData` in the above example.  
   * Make sure that one of the properties of the document object 
     is given the value `id(this)`.  
     <Admonition type="note" title="">
     The ETL task will use this property [to identify](../../../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/elasticsearch-etl-task.mdx#document-id-property-name) 
     documents that reside on the Elasticsearch destination by their source 
     RavenDB document ID.  
     </Admonition>
   * Use the `loadTo\<indexName\>` method to pass the document object 
     to the Elasticsearch destination.  

3. **Syntax**  
   Click for a transformation script Syntax Sample.  

4. **Collections**  
    * **Select (or enter) a collection**  
      Type or select the names of the collections your script is using.  
    * **Collections Selected**  
      A list of collections that were already selected.  

5. **Apply script to documents from beginning of time (Reset)**  
    * When this option is **enabled**:  
      The script will be executed over **all existing documents in the 
      specified collections** the first time the task runs.  
    * When this option is **disabled**:  
      The script will be executed **only over new and modified documents**.  
    * If [Insert Only](../../../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/elasticsearch-etl-task.mdx#elasticsearch-indexes) 
      is **enabled**:  
      RavenDB documents will be appended to Elasticsearch **without deleting documents from Elasticsearch first**.  
    * If [Insert Only](../../../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/elasticsearch-etl-task.mdx#elasticsearch-indexes) 
      is **disabled**:  
      Documents will be **deleted from Elasticsearch first**, and then appended to it from RavenDB.  

6. **Add/Update**  
   Click to add a new script or update the task with changes made in an existing script.  

7. **Cancel**  
   Click to cancel your changes.  

8. **Test Script**  
   Click to **test** the transformation script (read more about this option below).  
### Test Transformation Script

!["Transformation script"](./assets/elasticsearch-test-script-view.png)

1. **Document ID**  
   Type or select the ID of the document you want to test the script with.  
2. **Test**  
   Click to run the test.  
   The test will display the commands that would be sent to Elasticsearch, **without** actually sending them.  
3. **Close Test Area**  
   Close this view.  
### Test Results
