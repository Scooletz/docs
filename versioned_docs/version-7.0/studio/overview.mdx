# Studio Overview
<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

* RavenDB's **Management Studio** is installed along with the server and can 
  be accessed via any modern browser.  
  Access Studio using the server's URL, including its port number. E.g.: `http://localhost:8080` 

* Use Studio to manage your RavenDB 
  [cluster](../studio/cluster/cluster-dashboard/cluster-dashboard-overview), 
  [servers](../studio/server/manage-server), 
  and [databases](../studio/database/databases-list-view). 
  You can observe, modify, and create [indexes](../studio/database/indexes/indexes-overview), 
  issue [queries](../studio/database/queries/query-view), 
  adjust [settings](../studio/database/settings/database-settings), 
  view [statistics](../studio/database/stats/ongoing-tasks-stats/overview) 
  and [logs](../studio/server/debug/admin-logs), 
  define [ongoing tasks](../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/general-info),

## Accessing Studio After Setup

Studio, the server's GUI, is installed along with the server. You can connect to it 
using your browser to access and manage the server.  

<Admonition type="info" title="Secure and Unsecure servers" id="secure-and-unsecure-servers" href="#secure-and-unsecure-servers">
When a RavenDB server runs for the first time, it presents its user with 
a [setup wizard](../start/installation/setup-wizard#select-setup-mode).  
You can use this wizard to select whether to install a **Secure** server 
(with a [Let's Encrypt](../start/installation/setup-wizard#secure-setup-with-a-free-let) 
or a [self-obtained](../start/installation/setup-wizard#secure-setup-with-your-own-certificate) 
certificate) or an [Unsecure](../start/installation/setup-wizard#unsecure-setup) server.  
</Admonition>

Connecting your browser to Studio is **different** when the server you attempt to access 
is secure and when it isn't.  

## Connecting to an Unsecure server:

When connecting to an [unsecure](../start/installation/setup-wizard#unsecure-setup) 
server, **no certificate** is required and Studio can be directly connected using 
the server's URL.  
<Admonition type="warning" title="Warning">
Please be aware that using an unsecure server is **not** recommended except for 
experiments in a development environment.  
</Admonition>

## Connecting to a Secure server:

To connect to a **secure server**, the browser is required to own a **client certificate** 
with [admin privileges](../server/security/authentication/client-certificate-usage).  
Trying to connect to a secure server without a certificate 
[will fail](../server/security/common-errors-and-faq#authentication-error-occurred-using-edge).  

#### Where should the certificate be located?

Certificates must be installed where the browser can find them.  

* If you generate a [Let's Encrypt](../start/installation/setup-wizard#secure-setup-with-a-free-let) 
  certificate during setup, the certificate will be automatically registered in the browser's default 
  location. This location is browser-specific:  
  **Edge** looks for certificates in the OS root store.  
  **Firefox** looks for certificates in the browser's root store.  
  **Chrome** version 105 and up also looks for certificates in the [browser's root store](https://blog.chromium.org/2022/09/announcing-launch-of-chrome-root-program.html).  

* If you obtain the certificate [elsewhere](../start/installation/setup-wizard#secure-setup-with-your-own-certificate), 
  you need to ensure that it is properly registered where your browser can find it.  
  <Admonition type="note" title="Note">
  To register a certificate for Firefox or Chrome, you may need to 
  [explicitly import the certificate](../server/security/common-errors-and-faq#authentication-error-occurred-using-chrome) 
  into the browser's root store.  
  </Admonition>


## The Cluster Dashboard

* Open the **Cluster Dashboard** from Studio's main menu.  
* A [Let's get started](../studio/cluster/cluster-dashboard/cluster-dashboard-widgets#let) 
  widget makes for a great starting point If you are new to RavenDB or this is a fresh setup.  
  You can use it to set your cluster, create a first database, or learn about basic database features.  
* The dashboard is [fully customizable](../studio/cluster/cluster-dashboard/cluster-dashboard-customize), 
  allowing you to easily add, remove, and rearrange your diagnostics widgets so any visit 
  to this view would reveal precisely the information you're interested in.

## Manage your Server

To access your server's configuration and debugging options, open the **Manage Server** 
menu from Studio's main menu.  

![Main menu: Click to manage server](./assets/overview_click-to-manage-server.png)
The menu's **Cluster** option, for example, will allow you, among other options, 
to add your server to a cluster, see and change its role as a cluster node, and 
assign it CPU cores.

## Manage your Databases

Access the **Databases View** from Studio's main menu.  
![Click to manage databases](./assets/overview_click-to-manage-databases.png)

This is where databases can be easily created or deleted, and where you can 
view a concise summary of database metrics and perform operations like disabling 
or enabling a database or modifying its database group.
