# AI Connection Strings - Overview
<Admonition type="note" title="">

* In RavenDB, you can define [Embeddings Generation Tasks](../../ai-integration/generating-embeddings/overview.mdx) that generate embeddings from the content of your documents.
  These embeddings are stored in a dedicated collection within the database and enable vector search on your document content.

* Each embeddings generation task must define a **connection string** to an embedding provider.  
  This connection string specifies where the embeddings will be generated, 
  allowing RavenDB to integrate with external services such as OpenAI and any other OpenAI-compatible providers, as well as Azure OpenAI,  
  Hugging Face, Google AI, Ollama, Mistral AI, or RavenDBâ€™s embedded model (bge-micro-v2).

* While each task can have only one connection string, you can define multiple connection strings in your database to support different providers or configurations.  
  A single connection string can also be reused across multiple tasks in the database.

* These connection strings can be created from:
  * The **AI Connection Strings view** in the Studio, where you can create, edit, and delete connection strings that are not in use.
  * The **Client API** - examples are available in the dedicated articles for each provider.
* In this article:
  * [The AI Connection Strings view](../../ai-integration/connection-strings/connection-strings-overview.mdx#the-ai-connection-strings-view)
  * [Creating an AI connection string](../../ai-integration/connection-strings/connection-strings-overview.mdx#creating-an-ai-connection-string)

## The AI Connection Strings view

![connection strings view](./assets/connection-strings-view.png)

1. Go to the **AI Hub** menu.

2. Open the **AI Connection Strings** view.

3. Click **"Add new"** to create a new connection string.

4. View the list of all AI connection strings that have been defined.

5. Edit or delete a connection string.  
   Only connection strings that are not in use by a task can be deleted.



## Creating an AI connection string

![create connection string](./assets/create-connection-string.png)

1. **Name**  
   Enter a unique name for the connection string.

2. **Identifier**  
   Enter a unique identifier for the connection string.  
   Each AI connection string in the database must have a distinct identifier.

     If not specified, or when clicking the "Regenerate" button,  
     RavenDB automatically generates the identifier based on the connection string name. For example:
       * If the connection string name is: _"My connection string to Google AI"_
       * The generated identifier will be: _"my-connection-string-to-google-ai"_
  
     Allowed characters: only lowercase letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), and hyphens (-).  
     See how this identifier is used in the [embeddings cache collection](../../ai-integration/generating-embeddings/embedding-collections.mdx#the-embeddings-cache-collection).

3. **Regenerate**  
   Click "Regenerate" to automatically create an identifier based on the connection string name.

4. **Connector**  
   Select an AI provider from the dropdown menu.  
   This will open a dialog where you can configure the connection details.  
   Configuration details for each provider are explained in the following articles:
   * [Azure Open AI](../../ai-integration/connection-strings/azure-open-ai.mdx)
   * [Google AI](../../ai-integration/connection-strings/google-ai.mdx)
   * [Hugging Face](../../ai-integration/connection-strings/hugging-face.mdx)
   * [Ollama](../../ai-integration/connection-strings/ollama.mdx)
   * [OpenAI](../../ai-integration/connection-strings/open-ai.mdx)
   * [Mistral AI](../../ai-integration/connection-strings/mistral-ai.mdx)
   * [Embedded model (bge-micro-v2)](../../ai-integration/connection-strings/embedded.mdx)

5. Once you complete all configurations for the selected provider in the dialog,  
   save the connection string definition.
