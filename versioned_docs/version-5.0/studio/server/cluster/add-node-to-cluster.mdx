# Adding a Node to a Cluster
<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

* A server will be in a `Passive` state in either one of the following:  
  * When the server is started for the very first time  
  * When the server is removed from an existing cluster  

* To make a server become part of a cluster you can do _either_ of the following:  

  1. **Bootstrap Cluster**  
  2. **Adding another node** to this server cluster (will cause both to be part of the same cluster)  
  3. **Performing any RAFT command** on the `Passive` server will make the server become part of a cluster, e.g.:  
     * Adding a license  
     * Creating a database on this server  

* In this page:  
  * [Bootstrap Cluster](../../../studio/server/cluster/add-node-to-cluster.mdx#bootstrap-cluster)  
  * [Add Another Node to the Cluster](../../../studio/server/cluster/add-node-to-cluster.mdx#add-another-node-to-the-cluster)  
  * [A Cluster with 2 nodes](../../../studio/server/cluster/add-node-to-cluster.mdx#a-cluster-with-2-nodes)

## Bootstrap Cluster

Click _'Bootstrap Cluster'_ to make the current passive server a part of a cluster.  
Note: This option is only available when the server is in the `Passive` state.

## Add Another Node to the Cluster

![Figure 1. Click to add a new node](./assets/cluster-add-node-1.png)



![Figure 2. Adding a new node](./assets/cluster-add-node-2.png)

1. Enter the server URL of the new node  
2. Manually select a **Node Tag** for the new node. 
   The node tage is a unique identifier made up of 1-4 uppercase letters. By default, the tag of the 
   first node in a cluster is `A`, the second `B`, and so on. After `Z`, the next node will get the 
   tag `AA`, the next `AB`, and so on.  
3. Decide whether to add the new node as a `Member` -or- as a `Watcher` (difference explained in [Cluster View](cluster-view))  
4. Toggle whether to use all available cores on the machine for this node  
5. Set a maximum number of cores that can be used by this node  
6. Click _Test connection_ to verify that your cluster can communicate with the server at the specified URL  

When done, click *Save* to add this server as a node to the cluster  

This operation can also be done programatically. Read more [here](../../../server/clustering/cluster-api.mdx).


## A Cluster with 2 nodes

![Figure 3. Cluster with 2 nodes](./assets/cluster-add-node-3.png)

**Now your cluster contains 2 nodes**:  

* The server running on _localhost:8081_ shows as Node A and is the `Leader` of the cluster.  
* The server running on _localhost:8082_ shows as Node B and is a `Member` of the cluster.

 More nodes can be added as needed.
