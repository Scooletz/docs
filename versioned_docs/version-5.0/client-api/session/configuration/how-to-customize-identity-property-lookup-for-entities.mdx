# Session: How to Customize the Identity Property Lookup for Entities

The client must know which property of your entity is considered as an identity. By default, it always looks for the `Id` property (case-sensitive). This behavior can be changed by overwriting one of our conventions called `FindIdentityProperty`.

## Syntax

<TabItem value="identity_1" label="identity_1">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`Func<MemberInfo, bool> FindIdentityProperty \{ get; set; \}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

`MemberInfo` will represent the member of a stored entity, and return value (bool) will indicate if given member is an identity property.

## Example

The simplest example would be to check if the property name is equal to 'Identifier'.

<TabItem value="identity_2" label="identity_2">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`store.Conventions.FindIdentityProperty = memberInfo => memberInfo.Name == "Identifier";
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

The client must know which property of your entity is considered as an identity. By default, it always looks for the `id` field (case-sensitive). This behavior can be changed by overwriting one of our conventions called `findIdentityProperty`.

## Syntax

<TabItem value="identity_1" label="identity_1">
<CodeBlock language="java">
{`public void setFindIdentityProperty(Function<PropertyDescriptor, Boolean> findIdentityProperty);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

`PropertyDescriptor` will represent the property of a stored entity, and return value (bool) will indicate if given member is an identity property.

## Example

The simplest example would be to check if the property name is equal to 'Identifier'.

<TabItem value="identity_2" label="identity_2">
<CodeBlock language="java">
{`store.getConventions().setFindIdentityProperty(property -> "Identifier".equals(property.getName()));
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

## Example

Here's how to change it to `Identifier` field.

<TabItem value="identity_2" label="identity_2">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`store.conventions.identityProperty = "Identifier"; 
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
