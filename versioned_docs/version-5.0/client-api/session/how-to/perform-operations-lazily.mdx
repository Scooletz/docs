# Session: How to Perform Operations Lazily
<LanguageSwitcher supportedLanguages={supportedLanguages} />
<LanguageContent language="csharp">


Operation execution for operations such as `Load`, `Load with Includes`, `LoadStartingWith` and queries can be deferred till needed using **lazy session operations**. Those operations ca be accessed using `Lazily` property found in `Advanced` session operations.

## Operations

Available operations are:

- `Load` - described [here](../../../client-api/session/loading-entities.mdx#load).
- `Load with Includes` - described [here](../../../client-api/session/loading-entities.mdx#load-with-includes).
- `LoadStartingWith` - described [here](../../../client-api/session/loading-entities.mdx#loadstartingwith).
- `GetCompareExchangeValue` - described [here](../../../client-api/session/cluster-transaction.mdx#get-compare-exchange-lazily).  


## Querying

Dedicated article about lazy queries can be found [here](../../../client-api/session/querying/how-to-perform-queries-lazily.mdx).

## Example

<TabItem value="lazy_1" label="lazy_1">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`Lazy<Employee> employeeLazy = session
	.Advanced
	.Lazily
	.Load<Employee>("employees/1-A");

Employee employee = employeeLazy.Value; // load operation will be executed here
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

## Executing All Pending Lazy Operations

To execute all pending lazy operations use `ExecuteAllPendingLazyOperations` method from **eager session operations** found under `Eagerly` property in `Advanced` session operations.

<TabItem value="lazy_2" label="lazy_2">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`Lazy<IEnumerable<Employee>> employeesLazy = session
	.Query<Employee>()
	.Lazily();

session.Advanced.Eagerly.ExecuteAllPendingLazyOperations(); // query will be executed here

IEnumerable<Employee> employees = employeesLazy.Value;
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
