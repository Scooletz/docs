Authentication and authorization is based on [client X.509 certificates](../server/security/authorization/security-clearance-and-permissions.mdx).

The `certificate` property allows you to pass a certificate which will be used by the RavenDB client to connect to a server. 

<Admonition type="note" title="">
If your RavenDB instance is running on 'https', then your application has to use a client certificate in order to be able to access the server. You can find more information [here](../server/security/overview.mdx).

## Example

<TabItem value="client_cert" label="client_cert">
<CodeBlock language="java">
{`// load certificate
// pem file should contain both public and private key
KeyStore clientStore = CertificateUtils.createKeystore("c:\\\\ravendb\\\\app.client.certificate.pem");

try (DocumentStore store = new DocumentStore())  \{
    store.setCertificate(clientStore);
    store.setDatabase("Northwind");
    store.setUrls(new String[]\{ "https://my_secured_raven" \});

    store.initialize();

    // do your work here
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
