# Session: Include Time Series
<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

You can [Include](../../../../../client-api/session/loading-entities.mdx#load-with-includes) 
documents' time series data while retrieving the documents.  
The included data is held by the client's session, so it can 
be handed to the user instantly when requested without issuing 
an additional request to the server.  

* Time series data can be included while -  
   * [Loading a Document Using `session.Load`](../../../../../document-extensions/timeseries/client-api/session/include/with-session-load.mdx)  
   * [Loading a Document By Query Via `session.Query`](../../../../../document-extensions/timeseries/client-api/session/include/with-session-query.mdx)  
   * [Loading a Document By a Raw RQL Query Via `session.Advanced.RawQuery`](../../../../../document-extensions/timeseries/client-api/session/include/with-raw-queries.mdx)
