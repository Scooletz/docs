# Session: Delete Time Series
<Admonition type="note" title="">

Delete a range of time series entries using `TimeSeriesFor.Delete`.  

* You can delete a **single time series entry** or a **range of entries**.  

* In this page:  
      * [`TimeSeriesFor.Delete`](../../../../document-extensions/timeseries/client-api/session/delete.mdx#timeseriesfordelete)  
       * [Syntax](../../../../document-extensions/timeseries/client-api/session/delete.mdx#syntx)  
       * [Usage Flow](../../../../document-extensions/timeseries/client-api/session/delete.mdx#usage-flow)  
       * [Usage Samples](../../../../document-extensions/timeseries/client-api/session/delete.mdx#usage-samples)

## `TimeSeriesFor.Delete`

`TimeSeriesFor.Delete` is used for the removal of time series and 
time series entries.  

* There is no need to explicitly delete a time series; 
  the series is deleted when all its entries are deleted.  
* Attempting to delete nonexistent entries results in a no-op, 
  generating no exception.  




## Syntax

* There are two `TimeSeriesFor.Delete` methods:  
   * Delete a single time series entry.
<TabItem value="TimeSeriesFor-Delete-definition-single-timepoint" label="TimeSeriesFor-Delete-definition-single-timepoint">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`// Delete a single time-series entry
void Delete(DateTime at);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
   * Delete a range of time series entries.
<TabItem value="TimeSeriesFor-Delete-definition-range-of-timepoints" label="TimeSeriesFor-Delete-definition-range-of-timepoints">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`// Delete a range of time-series entries
void Delete(DateTime? from = null, DateTime? to = null);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

* **Parameters**  

    | Parameters | Type | Description |
    |:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
    | `at` | `DateTime` | Timestamp of the time series entry you want to delete. |
    | `from` (optional) | `DateTime?` | Delete the range of time series entries starting at this timestamp. <br/> Default: `DateTime.Min` |
    | `to` (optional) | `DateTime?` | Delete the range of time series entries ending at this timestamp. <br/> Default: `DateTime.Max` |


| from | `DateTime` | Range Start (optional) <br/>
| to | `DateTime` | Range End (optional) <br/> Default: `DateTime.Max` 



* **Return Value**  
  No return value.  

* **Exceptions**  
   * `DocumentDoesNotExistException` is thrown If the document doesn't exist.  
   * Attempting to delete nonexistent entries results in a no-op and does not generate an exception.  



## Usage Flow

* Open a session.  
* Create an instance of `TimeSeriesFor`.  
    * Either pass `TimeSeriesFor` an explicit document ID,  
      -or-  
      Pass it an [entity tracked by the session](../../../../client-api/session/loading-entities.mdx), 
      e.g. a document object returned from [session.Query](../../../../client-api/session/querying/how-to-query.mdx) 
      or from [session.Load](../../../../client-api/session/loading-entities.mdx#load).  
    * Pass `TimeSeriesFor` the time series name.  
* Call `TimeSeriesFor.Delete`.  
* Call `session.SaveChanges` for the action to take effect on the server.  



## Usage Samples

* Delete a single entry:  
<TabItem value="timeseries_region_Delete-TimeSeriesFor-Single-Time-Point" label="timeseries_region_Delete-TimeSeriesFor-Single-Time-Point">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`// Delete a single entry
using (var session = store.OpenSession())
\{
    session.TimeSeriesFor("users/john", "HeartRates")
        .Delete(baseline.AddMinutes(1));

    session.SaveChanges();
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

* Delete a range of entries:  
<TabItem value="timeseries_region_TimeSeriesFor-Delete-Time-Points-Range" label="timeseries_region_TimeSeriesFor-Delete-Time-Points-Range">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`// Delete a range of entries from the time series
using (var session = store.OpenSession())
\{
    session.TimeSeriesFor("users/john", "HeartRates")
        .Delete(baseline.AddSeconds(0), baseline.AddSeconds(9));

    session.SaveChanges();
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
