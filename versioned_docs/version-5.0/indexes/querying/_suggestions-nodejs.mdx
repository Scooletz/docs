RavenDB has an indexing mechanism built upon the Lucene engine which has a great suggestions feature. This capability allows a significant improvement of search functionalities enhancing the overall user experience of the application.

Let's consider an example where the users have the option to look for products by their name. The index and query would appear as follows:

<TabItem value="suggestions_1" label="suggestions_1">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`0
            // The resulting suggested terms:
            // ==============================

            console.log("Suggested terms:");
            // Results are available under the custom name entry
            suggestions["SomeCustomName"].suggestions.forEach(suggestedTerm => \{
                console.log("\\t" + suggestedTerm);
            \});
            
            // Suggested terms:
            //     chocolade
            //     schokolade
            //     chocolate
            //     chowder
            //     marmalade
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="suggestions_2" label="suggestions_2">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`// This query on index 'Products/ByName' has NO resulting documents
const products = await session
    .query(\{ indexName: "Products/ByName" \})
    .search("ProductName", "chokolade")
    .all();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

If our database has `Northwind` samples deployed then it will not return any results. However, we can ask RavenDB for help:

<Tabs groupId='languageSyntax'>
<TabItem value="Query" label="Query">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`const suggestionResult = await session
    .query({ indexName: "Products/ByName" })
    .suggestUsing(builder => builder.byField("name", "chaig"))
    .execute();

console.log("Did you mean?");

for (const suggestion of suggestionResult["name"].suggestions) {
    console.log("\\t" + suggestion);
}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="RQL" label="RQL">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`from index 'Products/ByName' 
select suggest('Name', 'chaig')
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

It will produce these suggestions:

    Did you mean?
        chang
        chai

## Suggest Over Multiple Words

RavenDB allows you to perform a suggestion query over multiple words.

<TabItem value="query_suggestion_over_multiple_words" label="query_suggestion_over_multiple_words">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`const resultsByMultipleWords = await session
    .query(\{ indexName: "Products/ByName" \})
    .suggestUsing(builder =>
        builder.byField("name", [ "chaig", "tof" ])
               .withOptions(\{
                    accuracy: 0.4,
                    pageSize: 5,
                    distance: "JaroWinkler",
                    sortMode: "Popularity"
               \}))
    .execute();

console.log("Did you mean?");

for (const suggestion of resultsByMultipleWords["name"].suggestions) \{
    console.log("\\t" + suggestion);
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

This will produce the following results:

    Did you mean?
        chai
        chang
        chartreuse
        chef
        tofu

## Remarks

<Admonition type="warning" title="Increased indexing time" id="increased-indexing-time" href="#increased-indexing-time">

Indexes with turned on suggestions tend to use a lot more CPU power than other indexes. This can impact indexing speed (querying is not impacted).
