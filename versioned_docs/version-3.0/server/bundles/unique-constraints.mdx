# Bundle: Unique Constraints



This bundle allows the user to impose unique constraints on the objects (useful for properties such as email or social security number).



## **How it works?**

The bundle works both on the server (using a PutTrigger and a DeleteTrigger) and on the client (using the `DocumentStoreListener` and providing extension methods on `IDocumentSession`).

When a document is stored in a database, it generates "dummy" documents with following key format: "UniqueConstraints/" + entityName + "/" + propertyName + "/" + propertyValue. This way you don't need indexes (which would have to be **not** stale to check for uniqueness).

### UniqueConstraintsStoreListener

The listener works by using reflection when the document is stored in the database and generating metadata regarding its unique constraints. The reflection result is cached in the `ConcurrentDictionary` to help with performance.

---

### UniqueConstraintsPutTrigger

The put trigger acts whenever it finds a document being inserted with metadata constraints. It checks for existing documents in the constraints. If any existing document is found, it returns a VetoResult.Deny, informing the conflicting fields. This has to be checked on the client-side, using a try block for the OperationVetoedException.

If a document is being updated, the trigger updates the generated constraint document.

---

### UniqueConstraintsDeleteTrigger

The delete trigger acts whenever it finds a document being deleted with constraints metadata . It deletes the referenced constraint documents.



## Installation

Drop the `Raven.Bundles.UniqueContraints` assembly in the Plugins directory.
