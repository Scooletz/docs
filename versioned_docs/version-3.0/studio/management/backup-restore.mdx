# Manage Your Server: Backup & Restore

`Backup` is used to create a backup of a database or a file system. All you need to do is give the name of a resource you want to backup, backup's location, and determine whether the backup should be incremental or not.

`Restore` is used to restore a backup. You need to provide a backup location and new database or file system name. Additionally, you may give a path to a place where the data should end up (if you choose not to, a default path will be used), carry out defragmentation and decide to disable replication
destinations after the successful restore.
