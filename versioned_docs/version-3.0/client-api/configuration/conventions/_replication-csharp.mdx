#Replication conventions



This conventions tells the client how it should behave in a replicated environment when the primary node is unreachable and need to failover to secondary node(s). Detailed description you will
find [here](../../bundles/how-client-integrates-with-replication-bundle.mdx).

<TabItem value="failover_behavior" label="failover_behavior">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`Conventions.FailoverBehavior = FailoverBehavior.AllowReadsFromSecondaries;
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

### ReplicationInformerFactory

This is called to provide replication behavior for the client. You can customize this to inject your own replication / failover logic by implementing `IDocumentStoreReplicationInformer`.

<TabItem value="replication_informer" label="replication_informer">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`Conventions.ReplicationInformerFactory = (url, jsonRequestFactory, requestTimeMetricGetter) =>
icationInformer(Conventions, jsonRequestFactory, requestTimeMetricGetter);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>


### IndexAndTransformerReplicationMode

It allows to change the replication mode for index and transformer definitions when they are created (or changed) by the client code (`AbstractIndexCreationTask.Execute` / `AbstractTransformerCreationTask.Execute`). It is an enum type with `[Flags]` attribute applied. The possible values are:

* `None` - neither indexes nor transformers are updated to replicated instances,
* `Indexes` - all created indexes are replicated.
* `Transformers` - all transformers are replicated.

By default both indexes and transformers are uploaded to the replication nodes:

<TabItem value="index_and_transformer_replication_mode" label="index_and_transformer_replication_mode">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`Conventions.IndexAndTransformerReplicationMode = IndexAndTransformerReplicationMode.Indexes |
                                                 IndexAndTransformerReplicationMode.Transformers;
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
