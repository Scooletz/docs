# Authorization: How to work with authorization bundle?

In order to use this bundle first activate it on the server. The description can be found in [server section](../../server/bundles/authorization.mdx).

To work with a database where authorization is configured you need to reference `Raven.Client.Authorization` on the client side.

<TabItem value="using" label="using">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`using Raven.Client.Authorization;
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

The Authorization Bundle usage on the client side is limited to three methods:

* SetAuthorizationFor - which sets up permissions and tags for a specific document.
* GetAuthorizationFor - which allows you to read what permission and tags were set on a specific document.
* SecureFor - setup which user and operation are being performed.

For example, here is the code for authorization hospitalization:

<TabItem value="secure_for" label="secure_for">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`session.SecureFor("Authorization/Users/DrHowser", "Hospitalization/Authorize");
Authorization.Patient mary = session.Load<Authorization.Patient>("Patients/MaryMallon");
mary.AuthorizeHospitalization();
session.SaveChanges();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

If the user doesn't have the permissions to authorize hospitalization, an error will be raised when the change to the database in the SaveChanges call is persistent.
