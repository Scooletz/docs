#What are Data Subscriptions?

Data subscription provide a reliable and handy way to retrieve documents from the database for processing purposes by application jobs.

To start a work with this feature you need to create a subscription in the database along with a set of conditions which a document has to be complied with to be sent
through subscription channel (collection name, key prefix or property filtering).

When you open the subscription it will send you all documents matching the specified criteria. Documents are sent in batches (its size is configurable along with connection options)
and once you process them (within the specified time) the whole batch is marked as processed. Documents are always sent in Etag order what means that already processed ones will never be send again over this subscription.
This also ensures that you never miss any document even in the presence of failure - subscription will retry to send documents from the last acknowledged and processed document (by tracking its Etag).

Every time you open the subscription you receive all new or changed documents since the last pulling. After you download and process all documents you can still
keep the subscription open to get new or modified documents. Under the hood the data subscription uses [Changes API](../changes/what-is-changes-api.mdx) to be notified about
any document changes, so it is able to immediately provide subscribers with new documents that match the subscription criteria.

The subscriptions are persistent and long lived objects. The subscription created by one client is accessible for the another one by opening it by using a unique subscription identifier
(however there can be only a single connected client at a time), so you are expected to hold on that id and make use of it. More details about managing and consuming data subscriptions 
you will find in further articles.


Data subscriptions are accessible by a document store. You can take advantage of sync or async data subscription API methods. They are respectively exposed by the following properties:

<TabItem value="accessing_subscriptions" label="accessing_subscriptions">
<CodeBlock language="java">
{`IReliableSubscriptions subscriptions = store.subscriptions();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
