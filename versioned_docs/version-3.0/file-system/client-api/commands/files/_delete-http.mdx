## Multiple files deletion

In order to delete multiple files you need to send the **DELETE** request to the search endpoint that specifies a query.
All files matching that query will be deleted. The actual delete operation is implemented as the background operation which identifier
is returned in the response. Later you use it to ask about the delete operation status.

## Syntax

<TabItem value="json" label="json">
<CodeBlock language="json">
{`curl \\
	http://\{serverUrl\}/fs/\{fileSystemName\}/search?query=\{query\}  \\
	-X DELETE
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

### Response

| Status code | Description |
| ----------- | - |
| `200` | OK means that delete by query operation has been scheduled |

| Return Value | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **OperationId** | The identifier of the background delete by query operation |

## Example

In order to start delete operation of all files located in the `/temp` folder and its subdirectories, run the following command:

<TabItem value="json" label="json">
<CodeBlock language="json">
{`curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/fs/NorthwindFS/search?query=__directoryName:/temp
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
\{
    "OperationId":1
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

Check the operation status by using the following endpoint:

<TabItem value="json" label="json">
<CodeBlock language="json">
{`curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/fs/NorthwindFS/operation/status
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

You will either get `OK` response with a state message or `NotFound` if the task completed successfully and was deleted.
