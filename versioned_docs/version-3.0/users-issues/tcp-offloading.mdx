#Tcp Offloading
## Symptoms: 
- Exception thrown in Raven client when accessing raven server,  exception was because of socket timeout
- General slow operation of client system

## Cause:
It appears that the machine hosting the RavenDB server had the TCP offload functionality enabled, which seems to be causing connection drops, a problem experienced also by other applications like SQL Server.

## Resolution:
Disabling TCP Offloading.
