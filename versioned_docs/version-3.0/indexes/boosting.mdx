# Boosting

Another great feature that Lucene engine provides and RavenDB leverages is called `boosting`. This feature gives user the ability to manually tune the relevance level of matching documents when performing a query. 

From the index perspective we can associate with an index entry a boosting factor and the higher value it has, the more relevant term will be. To do this we must use `Boost` extension method from `Raven.Client.Linq.Indexing` namespace.

To illustrate it better, let's jump straight into the example. To perform a query that will return employees that either `FirstName` or `LastName` is equal to **Bob** and to promote employees (move them to the top of the results) that `FirstName` matches the phrase, we must first create an index with boosted entry.

<Tabs groupId='languageSyntax'>
<TabItem value="AbstractIndexCreationTask" label="AbstractIndexCreationTask">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`public class Employees_ByFirstAndLastName : AbstractIndexCreationTask<Employee>
{
	public Employees_ByFirstAndLastName()
	{
		Map =
			employees =>
			from employee in employees
			select new
			{
				FirstName = employee.FirstName.Boost(10),
				LastName = employee.LastName
			};
	}
}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Commands" label="Commands">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`store
	.DatabaseCommands
	.PutIndex(
		"Employees/ByFirstAndLastName",
		new IndexDefinition
		{
			Map = @"from employee in docs.Employees
				select new
				{
					FirstName = employee.FirstName.Boost(10),
					LastName = employee.LastName
				}"
		});
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Next step is to perform a query against that index:

<TabItem value="boosting_3" label="boosting_3">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`// employees with 'FirstName' equal to 'Bob'
// will be higher in results
// than the ones with 'LastName' match
IList<Employee> results = session
    .Query<Employee, Employees_ByFirstAndLastName>()
    .Where(x => x.FirstName == "Bob" || x.LastName == "Bob")
    .ToList();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

## Remarks

<Admonition type="info" title="Info">
Boosting is also available when using `Search` method. You can read more about it [here](../indexes/querying/searching.mdx#boosting).
