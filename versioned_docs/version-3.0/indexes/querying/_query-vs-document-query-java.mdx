You might be wondering why does the RavenDB client offer two ways of querying by exposing `query` as well as `documentQuery` methods and what are
differences between them.

`documentQuery` is the lower level API that we use to query RavenDB. Therefore we have created `query`.

`query` is just a wrapper of `documentQuery`, so when you use `query` it always is translated to `documentQuery` object, which then builds a Lucene-syntax query that is sent to the server.
However we still expose `documentQuery` in advanced options to allow the users to have the full power of Lucene available to them. 

## Immutability

`documentQuery` is mutable while `query` is immutable. It means that you might get different results if you try to *reuse* a query. The usage of `query` method like in the following example:

<TabItem value="immutable_query" label="immutable_query">
<CodeBlock language="java">
{`QQueryAndLuceneQuery_User u = QQueryAndLuceneQuery_User.user;
IRavenQueryable<User> query = session
  .query(User.class)
  .where(u.name.startsWith("A"));

IRavenQueryable<User> ageQuery = query.where(u.age.gt(21));

IRavenQueryable<User> eyeColor = query.where(u.eyeColor.eq("blue"));
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

will cause that the queries will be translated into following Lucene-syntax queries:

`query - Name:A*`

`ageQuery - (Name:A*) AND (Age_Range:{Ix21 TO NULL})`

`eyeQuery - (Name:A*) AND (EyeColor:blue)`

The similar usage of `documentQuery`:

<TabItem value="mutable_lucene_query" label="mutable_lucene_query">
<CodeBlock language="java">
{`IDocumentQuery<User> documentQuery = session
  .advanced()
  .documentQuery(User.class)
  .whereStartsWith(u.name, "A");

IDocumentQuery<User> ageDocumentQuery = documentQuery.whereGreaterThan(u.age, (byte)21);

IDocumentQuery<User> eyeDocumentQuery = documentQuery.whereEquals(u.eyeColor, "blue");

// here all of the DocumentQuery variables are the same references
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

`documentQuery - Name:A*` (before creating `ageQuery`)

`ageLuceneQuery - Name:A* Age_Range:{Ix21 TO NULL}` (before creating `eyeDocumentQuery`)

`eyeLuceneQuery - Name:A* Age_Range:{Ix21 TO NULL} EyeColor:blue`

In result all created Lucene queries are the same query (actually the same instance). This is important hint that you should be aware if you are going to reuse `documentQuery`.

## Default query operator

The example above shows an another difference between querying methods. Note that the usage of `where` statement resulted in `AND` operator 
in the final Lucene query when using `query` method. In case of `documentQuery` usage the Lucene query has no operator between query conditions what means
that `OR` will be used. This is the default operator of Lucene engine. You are able to change that by using `usingDefaultOperator`:

<TabItem value="default_operator" label="default_operator">
<CodeBlock language="java">
{`session
  .advanced()
  .documentQuery(User.class)
  .usingDefaultOperator(QueryOperator.AND);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
