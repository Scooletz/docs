# Session: How to Change Maximum Number of Requests per Session
<LanguageSwitcher supportedLanguages={supportedLanguages} />
<LanguageContent language="csharp">


By default, maximum number of requests that session can send to server is **30**. This number, if everything is done correctly, should never be reached. Remote calls are expensive, and the number of remote calls per "session" should be as close to **1** as possible. If the limit is reached, it is a sure sign of either a `Select N+1` problem or other misuse of the session object.

Nevertheless, if needed, this number can be changed for single session or for all sessions.

## Single session

To change maximum number of requests in a single session just manipulate `MaxNumberOfRequestsPerSession` property value from `Advanced` session operations.

<TabItem value="max_requests_1" label="max_requests_1">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`session.Advanced.MaxNumberOfRequestsPerSession = 50;
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

## All sessions

To change maximum number of requests for all sessions (on particular store) the `MaxNumberOfRequestsPerSession` property from DocumentStore `Conventions` must be changed.

<TabItem value="max_requests_2" label="max_requests_2">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`store.Conventions.MaxNumberOfRequestsPerSession = 100;
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

<Admonition type="info" title="Injecting MaxNumberOfRequestsPerSession from the Server" id="injecting-maxnumberofrequestspersession-from-the-server" href="#injecting-maxnumberofrequestspersession-from-the-server">
The maximum number of requests for all sessions can also be configured via injected client configuration from the Server. You can read more about this [here](../../../studio/server/client-configuration.mdx).
