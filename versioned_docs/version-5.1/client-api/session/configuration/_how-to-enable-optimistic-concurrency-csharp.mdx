<Admonition type="note" title="">

* By default, optimistic concurrency checks are turned **off**. Changes made outside the session object will be overwritten. 
  Concurrent changes to the same document will use the _Last Write Wins_ strategy so a lost update anomaly is possible 
  with the default configuration of the [session](../../../client-api/session/what-is-a-session-and-how-does-it-work.mdx).

* You can enable the optimistic concurrency for either:
  * All sessions - enable globally, at the document store level  
  * A specific session - enable on a per-session basis  
  * A specific document  

* With optimistic concurrency __enabled__, RavenDB will generate a concurrency exception 
  (and abort all modifications in the current transaction) when trying to save a document that has been modified on the server side after the client loaded and modified it.

* The `ConcurrencyException` that might be thrown upon the `SaveChanges` call needs to be handled by the caller. 
  The operation can be retried (the document needs to be reloaded since it got changed meanwhile) or handle the error in a way that is suitable in a given scenario.

* In this page:
  * [Enable for specific session](../../../client-api/session/configuration/how-to-enable-optimistic-concurrency.mdx#enable-for-specific-session)
  * [Enable globally](../../../client-api/session/configuration/how-to-enable-optimistic-concurrency.mdx#enable-globally)
  * [Disable for specific document (when enabled on session)](../../../client-api/session/configuration/how-to-enable-optimistic-concurrency.mdx#disable-for-specific-document-(when-enabled-on-session))
  * [Enable for specific document (when disabled on session)](../../../client-api/session/configuration/how-to-enable-optimistic-concurrency.mdx#enable-for-specific-document-(when-disabled-on-session)) 

<Admonition type="warning" title="">

* Note that the `UseOptimisticConcurrency` setting only applies to documents that have been modified by the current session. 
  For example, if you load documents `users/1-A` and `users/2-A` in a session, make modifications only to `users/1-A`, and then call `SaveChanges`, 
  the operation will succeed regardless of the optimistic concurrency setting, even if `users/2-A` has been changed by another process in the meantime.

* However, if you modify both documents and attempt to save changes with optimistic concurrency turned on, an exception will be raised if `users/2-A` has been modified externally.  
  In this case, the updates to both `users/1-A` and `users/2-A` will be cancelled.

## Enable for specific session

<TabItem value="optimistic_concurrency_1" label="optimistic_concurrency_1">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`using (IDocumentSession session = store.OpenSession())
\{
    // Enable optimistic concurrency for this session
    session.Advanced.UseOptimisticConcurrency = true;

    // Save a document in this session
    Product product = new Product \{ Name = "Some Name" \};
    session.Store(product, "products/999");
    session.SaveChanges();

    // Modify the document 'externally' by another session 
    using (IDocumentSession otherSession = store.OpenSession())
    \{
        Product otherProduct = otherSession.Load<Product>("products/999");
        otherProduct.Name = "Other Name";
        otherSession.SaveChanges();

<Admonition type="warning" title="">

* Enabling optimistic concurrency in a session will ensure that changes made to a document will only be persisted 
  if the version of the document sent in the `SaveChanges()` call matches its version from the time it was initially read (loaded from the server).
 
* Note that it's necessary to enable optimistic concurrency for ALL sessions that modify the documents for which you want to guarantee that no writes will be silently discarded.
  If optimistic concurrency is enabled in some sessions but not in others, and they modify the same documents, the risk of the lost update anomaly still exists.

## Enable globally

* Optimistic concurrency can also be turned on for all sessions that are opened under a document store.

* Use the [store.Conventions.UseOptimisticConcurrency](../../../client-api/configuration/conventions.mdx#useoptimisticconcurrency) convention to enable globally.

<TabItem value="optimistic_concurrency_2" label="optimistic_concurrency_2">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`// Enable for all sessions that will be opened within this document store
store.Conventions.UseOptimisticConcurrency = true;

using (IDocumentSession session = store.OpenSession())
\{
    bool isSessionUsingOptimisticConcurrency = session.Advanced.UseOptimisticConcurrency; // will return true
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## Disable for specific document (when enabled on session)

* Optimistic concurrency can be turned OFF when __storing__ a specific document,  
  even when it is turned ON for an entire session (or globally).

* This is done by passing `null` as a change vector value to the [Store](../../../client-api/session/storing-entities.mdx) method.

<TabItem value="optimistic_concurrency_3" label="optimistic_concurrency_3">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`using (IDocumentSession session = store.OpenSession())
\{
    // Store document 'products/999'
    session.Store(new Product \{ Name = "Some Name" \}, id: "products/999");
    session.SaveChanges();
\}

using (IDocumentSession session = store.OpenSession())
\{
    // Enable optimistic concurrency for the session
    session.Advanced.UseOptimisticConcurrency = true;

    // Store the same document
    // Pass 'null' as the changeVector to turn OFF optimistic concurrency for this document
    session.Store(new Product \{ Name = "Some Other Name" \}, changeVector: null, id: "products/999");
    
    // This will NOT throw a ConcurrencyException, and the document will be saved
    session.SaveChanges();
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## Enable for specific document (when disabled on session)

* Optimistic concurrency can be turned ON when __storing__ a specific document,  
  even when it is turned OFF for an entire session (or globally).

* This is done by passing `string.Empty` as the change vector value to the [Store](../../../client-api/session/storing-entities.mdx) method.  
  Setting the change vector to an empty string will cause RavenDB to ensure that this document is a new one and doesn't already exist.
  A `ConcurrencyException` will be thrown if the document already exists. 

* If you don't supply a 'Change Vector' or if the 'Change Vector' is `null`, then optimistic concurrency will be disabled.  

* Setting optimistic concurrency for a specific document overrides the `UseOptimisticConcurrency` property from the `Advanced` session operations.
