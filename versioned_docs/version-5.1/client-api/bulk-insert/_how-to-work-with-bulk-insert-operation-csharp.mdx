* `BulkInsert` is useful when inserting a large quantity of data from the client to the server.  
* It is an optimized time-saving approach with a few [limitations](../../client-api/bulk-insert/how-to-work-with-bulk-insert-operation.mdx#limitations)
  such as transactionality and the possibility of interruptions during the operation.

## Syntax

<TabItem value="bulk_inserts_1" label="bulk_inserts_1">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`BulkInsertOperation BulkInsert(string database = null, CancellationToken token = default);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

| Parameters | | |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| **database** | string | Name of database for which bulk operation should be performed. If `null` then the `Database` from DocumentStore will be used. |
| **token** | CancellationToken | Cancellation token used in order to halt the worker operation. |

| Return Value | |
| ------------- | ----- |
| BulkInsertOperation| Instance of BulkInsertOperation used for interaction. |



## BulkInsertOperation

### Methods

| Signature | Description |
| ----------| ----- |
| **void Abort()** | Abort the operation |
| **void Store(object entity, IMetadataDictionary metadata = null)** | store the entity, identifier will be generated automatically on client-side. Optional, metadata can be provided for the stored entity. |
| **void Store(object entity, string id, IMetadataDictionary metadata = null)** | store the entity, with `id` parameter to explicitly declare the entity identifier. Optional, metadata can be provided for the stored entity.|
| **void StoreAsync(object entity, IMetadataDictionary metadata = null)** | store the entity in an async manner, identifier will be generated automatically on client-side. Optional, metadata can be provided for the stored entity. |
| **void StoreAsync(object entity, string id, IMetadataDictionary metadata = null)** | store the entity in an async manner, with `id` parameter to explicitly declare the entity identifier. Optional, metadata can be provided for the stored entity.|
| **void Dispose()** | Dispose an object |
| **void DisposeAsync()** | Dispose an object in an async manner |

### Limitations

There are a couple limitations to the API:

* BulkInsert is designed to efficiently push high quantities of data.  
  As such, data is streamed and **processed by the server in batches**.  
  Each batch is fully transactional, but there are no transaction guarantees between the batches. The operation as a whole is non-transactional. 
  If your bulk insert is interrupted mid-way, some of your data might be persisted on the server while some of it might not.  
  * Make sure that your logic accounts for the possibility of an interruption where some of your data has not yet persisted on the server.
  * If the operation was interrupted, one option is to re-insert the whole dataset in a new operation.  
    It will overwrite existing documents.
  * **If you need full transactionality**, the [session](../../client-api/session/what-is-a-session-and-how-does-it-work.mdx) may be a better option.  
    If using the session, because all of the data is processed in one transaction, your server resources must be able to handle the 
    entire data-set included in the transaction.  
* Bulk insert is **not thread-safe**.  
  A single bulk insert should not be accessed concurrently.  
  * The use of multiple bulk inserts concurrently on the same client is supported.  
  * Also the use in an async context is supported.



## Example

### Create bulk insert

Here we create a bulk insert operation and inserting a million documents of type Employee
<Tabs groupId='languageSyntax'>
<TabItem value="sync" label="sync">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`using (BulkInsertOperation bulkInsert = store.BulkInsert())
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000 * 1000; i++)
    {
        bulkInsert.Store(new Employee
        {
            FirstName = "FirstName #" + i,
            LastName = "LastName #" + i
        });
    }
}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="async" label="async">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`BulkInsertOperation bulkInsert = null;
try
{
    bulkInsert = store.BulkInsert();
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000 * 1000; i++)
    {
        await bulkInsert.StoreAsync(new Employee

        });
    }
}
finally

    if (bulkInsert != null)
    {
        await bulkInsert.DisposeAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);
    }
}
`}
