* The **Compare Exchange** feature allows you to perform cluster-wide _interlocked_ distributed operations.  

* Unique **Keys** can be reserved in the [Database Group](../../../studio/database/settings/manage-database-group.mdx) accross the cluster.  
  Each key has an associated **Value**.  

* Modifying these values is an ***interlocked compare exchange*** operation.  

* Once defined, the Compare Exchange Values can be accessed via [GetCompareExchangeValuesOperation](../../../client-api/operations/compare-exchange/get-compare-exchange-values.mdx),  
  or by using RQL in a query (see example-I below)

## Compare Exchange Transaction Scope

* Since the compare-exchange operations guarantee atomicity across the entire cluster, 
  the feature is **not** using the transaction associated with a session object, as a session transaction spans only a single node.  

* So if a compare-exchange operation has failed when used inside a session block, it will **not** be rolled back automatically upon a session transaction failure.  


## Creating a Key

* Provide the following when saving a **key**:

| Parameter | Description |
| ------------- | ---- |
| **Key** | A string under which _Value_ is saved, unique in the database scope across the cluster. This string can be up to 512 bytes. |
| **Value** | The Value that is associated with the _Key_. 
Can be a number, string, boolean, array or any JSON formatted object. |
| **Index** | The _Index_ number is indicating the version of _Value_.
The _Index_ is used for the concurrency control, similar to documents Etags. |

* When creating a _new_ 'Compare Exchange Key', the index should be set to `0`.  

* The [Put](../../../client-api/operations/compare-exchange/put-compare-exchange-value.mdx) operation will succeed only if this key doesn't exist yet.  

* Note: Two different keys _can_ have the same values as long as the keys are unique.  


## Updating a Key

* Updating a 'Compare Exchange' key can be divided into 2 phases:

  1. [Get](../../../client-api/operations/compare-exchange/get-compare-exchange-value.mdx) the existing _Key_. The associated _Value_ and _Index_ are received.  

  2. The _Index_ obtained from the read operation is provided to the [Put](../../../client-api/operations/compare-exchange/put-compare-exchange-value.mdx) operation along with the new _Value_ to be saved.  
     This save will succeed only if the index that is provided to the 'Put' operation is the **same** as the index that was received from the server in the previous 'Get', 
     which means that the _Value_ was not modified by someone else between the read and write operations.


## Example I - Email Address Reservation  

* Compare Exchange can be used to maintain uniqueness across users emails accounts.  

* First try to reserve a new user email.  
  If the email is successfully reserved then save the user account document.  

<TabItem value="email" label="email">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`string email = "user@example.com";

User user = new User
\{
    Email = email
\};

using (IDocumentSession session = store.OpenSession())
\{
    session.Store(user);
    // At this point, the user document has an Id assigned

    // Try to reserve a new user email 
    // Note: This operation takes place outside of the session transaction, 
    //       It is a cluster-wide reservation
    CompareExchangeResult<string> cmpXchgResult
        = store.Operations.Send(
            new PutCompareExchangeValueOperation<string>("emails/" + email, user.Id, 0));

    if (cmpXchgResult.Successful == false)
        throw new Exception("Email is already in use");

    // At this point we managed to reserve/save the user email -
    // The document can be saved in SaveChanges
    session.SaveChanges();
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>  

**Implications**:

* The `User` object is saved as a document, hence it can be indexed, queried, etc.  

* If `session.SaveChanges` fails, the email reservation is _not_ rolled back automatically. It is your responsibility to do so.  

* The compare exchange value that was saved can be accessed from `RQL` in a query:  

<Tabs groupId='languageSyntax'>
<TabItem value="Sync" label="Sync">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`using (IDocumentSession session = store.OpenSession())
{
    var query = from u in session.Query<User>()
                where u.Id == RavenQuery.CmpXchg<string>("emails/ayende@ayende.com")
                select u;

    var q = session.Advanced
        .DocumentQuery<User>()
        .WhereEquals("Id", CmpXchg.Value("emails/ayende@ayende.com"));
}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>  
<TabItem value="RQL" label="RQL">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`from Users as s where id() == cmpxchg("emails/ayende@ayende.com")
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Example II - Reserve a Shared Resource  

* Use compare exchange for a shared resource reservation.  

* The code also checks for clients who never release resources (i.e. due to failure) by using timeout.  

<TabItem value="shared_resource" label="shared_resource">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`private class SharedResource
\{
    public DateTime? ReservedUntil \{ get; set; \}
\}

public void PrintWork() 
\{
    // Try to get hold of the printer resource
    long reservationIndex = LockResource(store, "Printer/First-Floor", TimeSpan.FromMinutes(20));

    try
    \{
        // Do some work for the duration that was set.
        // Don't exceed the duration, otherwise resource is available for someone else.
    \}
    finally
    \{
        ReleaseResource(store, "Printer/First-Floor", reservationIndex);
    \}
\}

public long LockResource(IDocumentStore store, string resourceName, TimeSpan duration)
\{
    while (true)
    \{
        DateTime now = DateTime.UtcNow;

        SharedResource resource = new SharedResource
        \{
            ReservedUntil = now.Add(duration)
        \};

        CompareExchangeResult<SharedResource> saveResult = store.Operations.Send(
                new PutCompareExchangeValueOperation<SharedResource>(resourceName, resource, 0));

        if (saveResult.Successful)
        \{
            // resourceName wasn't present - we managed to reserve
            return saveResult.Index;
        \}

        // At this point, Put operation failed - someone else owns the lock or lock time expired
        if (saveResult.Value.ReservedUntil < now)
        \{
            // Time expired - Update the existing key with the new value
            CompareExchangeResult<SharedResource> takeLockWithTimeoutResult = store.Operations.Send(
                new PutCompareExchangeValueOperation<SharedResource>(resourceName, resource, saveResult.Index));

            if (takeLockWithTimeoutResult.Successful)
            \{
                return takeLockWithTimeoutResult.Index;
            \}
        \}

        // Wait a little bit and retry
        Thread.Sleep(20);
    \}
\}

public void ReleaseResource(IDocumentStore store, string resourceName, long index)
\{
    CompareExchangeResult<SharedResource> deleteResult
        = store.Operations.Send(new DeleteCompareExchangeValueOperation<SharedResource>(resourceName, index));

    // We have 2 options here:
    // deleteResult.Successful is true - we managed to release resource
    // deleteResult.Successful is false - someone else took the lock due to timeout 
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
