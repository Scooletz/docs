# Highly Available Tasks
<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

* A **RavenDB Task** can be one of the following:  

  * An [Ongoing Task](../../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/general-info.mdx)  
  * Updating a `Rehab` or a `Promotable` [Database Node](../../../server/clustering/distribution/distributed-database.mdx#database-topology)  

* There is no single coordinator handing out tasks to a specific node.  
  Instaed, each node decides on its own if it is the [Reponsible Node](../../../server/clustering/distribution/highly-available-tasks.mdx#responsible-node) of the task.  

* Each node will re-evaluate its responsibilities with every change made to the [Database Record](../../../client-api/operations/server-wide/create-database.mdx),  
  such as defining a new _index_, configuring or modifying an _Ongoing Task_, any _Database Topology_ change, etc.

  * [License](../../../server/clustering/distribution/highly-available-tasks.mdx#license)  
  * [Constraints](../../../server/clustering/distribution/highly-available-tasks.mdx#constraints)

  * [Tasks Relocation](../../../server/clustering/distribution/highly-available-tasks.mdx#tasks-relocation)

## License

Please see [available license types](https://ravendb.net/buy) and check your 
[own license](http://live-test.ravendb.net/studio/index.html#about) 
to verify whether the Highly Available Tasks feature is activated in your database.  
  
* If your license **provides** highly available tasks, the responsibilities of 
  a failed cluster node will be assigned automatically to another, available, node.  
  
    Supported tasks include:  
     * Backup  
     * Data subscription  
     * All ETL types  

* If your license does **not** provide highly available tasks, the responsibilites of a failed node will be 
  resumed when the node returns online.  
 
* Scenarios [below](../../../server/clustering/distribution/highly-available-tasks.mdx#tasks-relocation) 
  are meant to demonstrate the behavior of a system licensed for highly available tasks.  



## Constraints

1. Task is defined per [Database Group](../../../server/clustering/distribution/distributed-database.mdx).  

2. Task is executed by a single `Database Node` only.  
   With Backup Task being an exception in case of a cluster partition, see [Backup Task - When Cluster or Node are Down](../../../studio/database/tasks/backup-task.mdx#when-the-cluster-or-node-are-down).  

3. A `Database Node` can be assigned with many tasks.  

4. The node must be in a [Member](../../../server/clustering/distribution/distributed-database.mdx#database-topology) state in the `Database Group` in order to perform a task.  

5. Cluster must be in a functional state.  


## Responsible Node

* `Responsible Node` is the node that is responsible to perform a specific Ongoing Task.  

* Each node checks whether it is the `Responsible Node` for the task by executing a local function that is based on the  
  _unique hash value_ of the task and the current [Database Topology](../../../server/clustering/distribution/distributed-database.mdx#database-topology).  

* Since the `Database Topology` is _eventually consistent_ across the cluster,  
  there will be an **eventually consistent single Responsible Node**, which will answer the above constraints.

## Tasks Relocation

Upon a `Database Topology` change, _all_ existing tasks will be re-evaluated and 
re-distributed among the functional nodes.   

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

**For example**:  

Let's assume that we have a 5 nodes cluster [A, B, C, D, E] with a database on [A, B, E] and a task on node B.  

Node B has network issues and is separated from the cluster. 
So nodes [A, C, D, E] are on one side and node [B] is on the other side.  

The [Cluster Observer](../../../server/clustering/distribution/cluster-observer.mdx) will note that it can't reach node B 
and issue a [Raft Command](../../../server/clustering/rachis/consensus-operations.mdx) in order to move node B to a `Rehab` state.  

Once this change has propagated, it will trigger a re-assessment of _all_ tasks in _all_ reachable nodes.  
In our example the task will move to either A or E.  

In the meanwhile, node B which has no communication with the [Cluster Leader](../../../server/clustering/rachis/cluster-topology.mdx),  
moves itself to be a `Candidate` and removes all its tasks.
