* Go to **Settings** &gt; **Documents Compression** to configure compression for a 
particular database.  

* Go to the **Storage Report** to see the contents and size of your database' 
storage.  

* In this page:

## Configure Documents Compression

RavenDB will compress documents for selected collections, when storing those documents.  
The compression will be applied to:  

* Newly created documents  
* Existing documents that are modified and saved  

An existing document opened just for reading will **not** be compressed.

2. List of selected collections.  
3. Toggle whether to activate compression for all revisions of all collections.  
4. Save and apply configuration.  



## Database Storage Report

Each database has a page **Stats** &gt; **Storage Report** that displays detailed information 
about the contents of its storage. Go here to see the effects of the compression. Refresh the 
page to see changes.
