<Admonition type="info" title="Help Us Improve Prompt" id="help-us-improve-prompt" href="#help-us-improve-prompt">
When you first launch RavenDB, you will see this prompt asking if you'd be willing to 
anonymously share some Studio usage data with us in order to help us improve RavenDB:  

![NoSQL Database Share Studio Usage](./assets/help-us-improve.png)

Once you respond to this prompt, it should not appear again. However, in some scenarios, 
such as running RavenDB embedded, or working without browser cookies, the prompt may 
appear again.  

If necessary, you can add this flag to the Studio URL to prevent the prompt from 
appearing:  

`<Studio URL>#dashboard?disableAnalytics=true`
