#The Azure router timeout
## Symptoms:
-  Exception is thrown in RavenDB client when accessing raven server,  exception was because of socket timeout or general connection failure
- Problem happens mainly on Azure hosted VMs

## Cause:
Azure's load balancer closes connections that are idle for more than 60 seconds

## Resolution:
We have to make sure that there are no connections that are idle for more than 60 seconds.
There are two possible ways to do that:

- Make sure that RavenDB is accessed at least once a minute (consider having a keep-alive message)
- Change service point manager's [MaxIdleTime](https://msdn.microsoft.com/query/dev12.query?appId=Dev12IDEF1&l=EN-US&k=k(System.Net.ServicePointManager.MaxServicePointIdleTime);k(TargetFrameworkMoniker-.NETFramework,Version%3Dv4.5);k(DevLang-csharp)&rd=true) value in your client application
