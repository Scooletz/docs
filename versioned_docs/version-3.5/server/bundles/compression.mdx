# Bundle: Compression

To reduce the cost of I/O operations and reduce the size of the database on a disk, we have introduced the `Compression` bundle. Compression is only applied to documents, indexes are not compressed. This is because RavenDB is performing a lot of random reads from indexes, whereas with documents we almost always read/write the full content. Note that the compression process is fully transparent for the end-user.

## How to enable compression

To activate compression server-wide, just add the `Compression` to the `Raven/ActiveBundles` configuration in the global configuration file or set up a new database with compression bundle turned on, using API or the Studio.

More on how to create a database with compression enabled using the Studio [here](../../studio/walkthroughs/how-to-setup-compression.mdx).

<TabItem value="compression_1" label="compression_1">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`store
	.DatabaseCommands
	.GlobalAdmin
	.CreateDatabase(
		new DatabaseDocument
			\{
				Id = "CompressedDB",
				// Other configuration options omitted for simplicity
				Settings =
					\{
						// ...
						\{ "Raven/ActiveBundles", "Compression" \}
					\}
			\});
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

The above example demonstrates how to create a new database called `CompressedDB` with  the `Compression` bundle enabled.

<Admonition type="warning" title="Warning">
Activating the **compression** bundle is only supported for **new databases**. Activating or disabling compression on an already existing database will cause DB malfunction.
