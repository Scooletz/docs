# Bundle: Cascade Delete

The cascade delete bundle allows a specified set of documents and attachments to be deleted when the document that owns it is deleted. Typical usage scenarios include deleting an attachment that is referenced by a document, or removing a set of child documents referenced by a parent document.

## Installation

Simply place the Raven.Bundles.CascadeDelete.dll (included in RavenDB distribution package) in the `Plugins` directory.

To activate cascade delete server-wide, simply add `Cascade Delete` to `Raven/ActiveBundles` configuration in the global configuration file, or setup a new database with the cascade delete bundle turned on using API or the Studio

<Admonition type="note" title="Important" id="important" href="#important">
Any bundle which is not added to ActiveBundles list, will not be active, even if the relevant assembly is in the `Plugins` directory.
</Admonition>

## Usage

You can specify the documents and attachments to be cascade deleted using the following code:

<TabItem value="cascadedelete1" label="cascadedelete1">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`using (IDocumentSession session = store.OpenSession())
\{
	session.Store(parent);
	session.Advanced.GetMetadataFor(parent)["Raven-Cascade-Delete-Documents"] = RavenJToken.FromObject(new[] \{ "childId1", "childId2" \});
	session.Advanced.GetMetadataFor(parent)["Raven-Cascade-Delete-Attachments"] = RavenJToken.FromObject(new[] \{ "attachmentId1", " attachmentId2" \});
	session.SaveChanges();
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

When the "parent" document is deleted, the documents with "childId1" and "childId2" IDs and the attachments with "attachmentId1" and "attachmentId2" IDs will be deleted as well.

**Notes:**

1. The `Raven-Cascade-Delete-Documents` and `Raven-Cascade-Delete-Attachment` collections are independent from each other; a document can specify any number (from zero up) of the documents or attachments to be cascade deleted.
2. Cascade Delete works only within a single node. If you have a sharded data set, cascading will not delete documents / attachments that are located on other nodes.
