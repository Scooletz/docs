# Configuration: Storage Engines



RavenDB supports two storage engines and each database can be created with a different one:

- _(Default)_ ESE (Extensible Storage Engine aka Esent) - Microsoft storage engine available in Windows. More info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Storage_Engine).
- Voron - custom made managed storage engine created by Hibernating Rhinos.



## **Esent**

### Limitations

- **key size must be less than 2048 bytes in Unicode**



## **Voron**

### Limitations

- **key size must be less than 2024 bytes in UTF8**
- no support for DTC transactions

### Requirements

- disk must handle UNBUFFERED_IO/WRITE_THROUGH properly
- .NET 4.5 or higher
- [Hotfix](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2731284/33-dos-error-code-when-memory-memory-mapped-files-are-cleaned-by-using) for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2

## **Using Studio**

In order to change a storage engine in the Studio, while you are creating a database, go to `Advanced Settings` and change `Storage Engine` according to your needs.
