#Conventions related to caching



Use this convention to determine if the client should cache the request for the given URL. By default all requests are cached:

<TabItem value="should_cache" label="should_cache">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`Conventions.ShouldCacheRequest = url => true;
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

### ShouldAggressiveCacheTrackChanges

It decides whether the client being in [the aggressive cache](../../how-to/setup-aggressive-caching.mdx) mode should use [Changes API](../../changes/what-is-changes-api.mdx) to monitor notifications and rebuild the cache based on them.
If the notification arrives then an outdated item from cache will be revalidated. 

<TabItem value="should_aggressive_cache_track_changes" label="should_aggressive_cache_track_changes">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`Conventions.ShouldAggressiveCacheTrackChanges = true;
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

Note that it is still possible to get a stale result because of the time needed to receive the notification and checking for cached data.

### ShouldSaveChangesForceAggressiveCacheCheck

In addition to the use of notifications, the aggressive cache also revalidates the cache after calling `session.SaveChanges()`. 
This behavior is configurable by the following convention:

<TabItem value="should_save_changes_force_aggressive_cache_check" label="should_save_changes_force_aggressive_cache_check">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`Conventions.ShouldSaveChangesForceAggressiveCacheCheck = true;
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
