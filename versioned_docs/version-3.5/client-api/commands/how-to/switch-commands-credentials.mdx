# Commands: How to switch commands credentials?
<LanguageSwitcher supportedLanguages={supportedLanguages} />

By default, commands available directly in store are working with credentials that were set up for that store. To use different credentials for commands use **With** method.

## Syntax

<TabItem value="with_1" label="with_1">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`IDatabaseCommands With(ICredentials credentialsForSession);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

| Parameters | | |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| **credentialsForSession** | ICredentials | credentials that should be used by new commands |

| Return Value | |
| ------------- | ----- |
| IDatabaseCommands | New instance of commands that will use given credentials. |

## Example

<TabItem value="with_2" label="with_2">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`IDatabaseCommands commands = store
	.DatabaseCommands
	.With(new NetworkCredential("otherUserName", "otherPassword"));
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>


</LanguageContent>
<LanguageContent language="java">


Switching is not available in java (As we support only OAuth)
