# Indexes: Indexes View

This view lists all available indexes in a current database and gives you the ability to create, edit, query, or delete indexes. Indexes are grouped by a collection they are working on and each index contains basic information, such as a number of indexed entries and locked state.

## Action Bar

Action Bar in this View contains the following capabilities:

- `New Index` - Redirects to [Index Edit View](../../../studio/overview/indexes/index-edit-view.mdx) where you can create a new index,
- `Query` - Redirects to [Query View](../../../studio/overview/query/query-view.mdx),
- `Collapse All` - Collapses all indexes,
- `Paste` - Quickly creates index by pasting [IndexDefinition](../../../glossary/index-definition.mdx),
- `Lock Mode` - Set lock mode to all indexes,
- `Index Merge Suggestions` - retrieves all suggestions for an index merging,
- `Delete` - Removes idle/disabled/abandoned/all indexes,
- `Search` - Search for an index

## Querying

After clicking on an index name you will be navigated to the `Query View`. To read more about querying in Studio, please visit [this](../../../studio/overview/query/query-view.mdx) article.

## Editing

To edit index just press the `Edit` button available for each index. This will navigate you to the `Index Edit View` about which you can read [here](../../../studio/overview/indexes/index-edit-view.mdx).

## Menu


The following menu actions are available in the index menu:

### Copying

When the `Copy index` button is pressed, the index definition is loaded from a server and a popup from which it can be copied appears. Later on this definition can be used to create a new index with the `Paste` action from  the `Action Bar` (remember to change an index name).

### Deleting

If you want to delete an index (with the indexing data) press the `Delete index` button in the menu.

### Locking

You can read more about locking [here](../../../server/administration/index-administration.mdx#index-locking).

### Index Prioritization

You can read more about index prioritization [here](../../../server/administration/index-administration.mdx#index-prioritization).

### Index Corruption

During server startup, we check for corrupted indexes. If such a corruption is found, the server attempts to fix it.   
If an index gets corrupted while the server is running, the following warning message will be displayed:
![Figure 8. Studio. Indexes View. Index Corruption Message](./assets/indexes-view-corruption-1.png)

You might also get the following error when attempting to query:   
![Figure 9. Studio. Indexes View. Index Corruption Query Error](./assets/indexes-view-corruption-2.png)

If you encounter this problem, you should fix the corrupted index by going to the `Indexes` view and 
clicking `Try to recover corrupted indexes`:
