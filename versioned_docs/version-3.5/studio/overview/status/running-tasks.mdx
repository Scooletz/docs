-  `IndexDeleteOperation`,
-  `BackupDatabase`,
-  `BackupFilesystem`,
-  `ImportDatabase`,

 Each filter will appear if at least one type of this task is currently running. You can refresh the list of running tasks by clicking on the `Refresh` button and search for the specific tasks using `Search` option.
