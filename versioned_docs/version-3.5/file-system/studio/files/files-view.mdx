#Files view

The main view in the file system studio is a file explorer that allows you to browse and modify your files. It has the standard layout where
the directory structure is visible on the left side while a list files of the selected directory occupies right side of the view. The name of the file system
in the directory structure means the root directory.

## Creating a folder

Directories in RavenFS are created automatically based on file names which are always full paths. The studio provides a feature to create
folders virtually in order to build the appropriate structure before a file upload. Use `New Folder` button located above the directory 
structure to create a new folder (it will become a subfolder of the currently selected one):

![Figure 2. Studio. Files View. Create folder](./assets/files-view-create-folder.png)  

The folder remains virtual as long as it is empty. If you switch between studio pages without uploading any file there then it will disappear.

To *persist* this folder you need to add a file there.
