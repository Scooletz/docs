#Commands: Delete

There are two methods that allow to delete a single file or multiple files at once.



The **DeleteAsync** method is used to delete a file.

## Syntax

<TabItem value="delete_1" label="delete_1">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`Task DeleteAsync(string filename, Etag etag = null);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

| Parameters | | |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| **filename** | string | The name of a file to be deleted |
| **etag** | Etag | The current file Etag, used for concurrency checks (`null` skips check) |

---

| Return Value | |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **Task** | A task that represents the asynchronous delete operation. |

## Example

<TabItem value="delete_2" label="delete_2">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`await store.AsyncFilesCommands.DeleteAsync("/movies/intro.avi");
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>





## DeleteByQueryAsync

The **DeleteByQueryAsync** is used to delete files that match the specified query.

## Syntax

<TabItem value="delete_by_query_1" label="delete_by_query_1">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`Task DeleteByQueryAsync(string query);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

| Parameters | | |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| **query** | string | The Lucene query |

---

| Return Value | |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **Task** | A task that represents the asynchronous delete operation. |

## Example

In order to delete files located in `/temp` folder except from ones in its subdirectories, run the following code:

<TabItem value="delete_by_query_2" label="delete_by_query_2">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`await store.AsyncFilesCommands.DeleteByQueryAsync("__directoryName:/temp AND __level:2");
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



<Admonition type="info" title="Delete on the server side" id="delete-on-the-server-side" href="#delete-on-the-server-side">
To delete a file, RavenFS needs to remove a lot of information related to this file. In order to respond to the user quickly, the file is just renamed and a delete marker is added to its metadata. The actual delete is performed by [a periodic task](../../../server/background-tasks.mdx), which ensures that all the requested deletes will be accomplished even in the presence of a server restarts in the middle.
