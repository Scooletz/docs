* A __proximity search__ retrieves documents containing search terms that are located within a specified distance from each other.
  The distance is measured by the number of intermediate terms.
 
* Use the `proximity` method when making a __full-text search__ using the [search](../../../../client-api/session/querying/text-search/full-text-search.mdx) method.

* In this page:

## Why use proximity search

* A basic linguistic assumption is that the proximity of the words implies a relationship between them.  

* Proximity search helps match phrases while avoiding scattered or spread-out terms in the text.

* By limiting the search to only include matches where the terms are within the specified maximum proximity,  
  the search results can be more relevant than those with scattered terms.



## How proximity works

* When searching with some specified distance between search terms: `term1` and `term2`:

  * Documents that will be returned will contain text where `term1` and `term2` are separated by  
    the maximum number of terms specified or less.

  * The search terms can be separated by fewer terms, but not more than the specified distance.

  * Only the terms generated by the [search analyzer](../../../../indexes/using-analyzers.mdx#ravendb) are considered towards the count of the maximum distance.  
    Words or tokens that are Not part of the generated terms are Not included in the proximity calculation.

* Note:

  * Search criteria should contain least 2 search terms.

  * Search terms must be simple string terms without wildcards.

__Proximity search (0 distance)__

<Tabs groupId='languageSyntax'>
<TabItem value="Query" label="Query">

// The word "in" is not taken into account as it is Not part of the terms list generated
// by the analyzer. (Search is case-insensitive in this case).

// Note:
// A document containing text with the search terms appearing with no words in between them
