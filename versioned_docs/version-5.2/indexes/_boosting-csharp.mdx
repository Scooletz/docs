A feature that RavenDB leverages from Lucene is called Boosting. This feature gives you the ability to manually tune the relevance level of matching documents when performing a query. 

From the index perspective we can associate to an index entry a boosting factor. The higher value it has, the more relevant term will be. To do this, we must use the `Boost` extension method from the `Raven.Client.Documents.Linq.Indexing` namespace.

Let's jump straight into the example. To perform the query that will return employees where either `FirstName` or `LastName` is equal to _Bob_, and to promote employees (move them to the top of the results) where `FirstName` matches the phrase, we must first create an index with boosted entry.

<Tabs groupId='languageSyntax'>
<TabItem value="AbstractIndexCreationTask" label="AbstractIndexCreationTask">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`public class Employees_ByFirstAndLastName : AbstractIndexCreationTask<Employee>
{
    public Employees_ByFirstAndLastName()
    {
        Map =
            employees =>
            from employee in employees
            select new
            {
                FirstName = employee.FirstName.Boost(10),
                LastName = employee.LastName
            };
    }
}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Operation" label="Operation">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`store
    .Maintenance
    .Send(new PutIndexesOperation(new IndexDefinition
    {
        Name = "Employees/ByFirstAndLastName",
        Maps =
        {
            @"from employee in docs.Employees
              select new
              {
                  FirstName = employee.FirstName.Boost(10),
                  LastName = employee.LastName
              }"
        }
    }));
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The next step is to perform a query against that index:

<TabItem value="boosting_3" label="boosting_3">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`// employees with 'FirstName' equal to 'Bob'
// will be higher in results
// than the ones with 'LastName' match
IList<Employee> results = session
    .Query<Employee, Employees_ByFirstAndLastName>()
    .Where(x => x.FirstName == "Bob" || x.LastName == "Bob")
    .ToList();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

## Remarks

Boosting is also available at the query level. You can read more about it [here](../client-api/session/querying/text-search/boost-search-results.mdx).
