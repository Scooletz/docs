* By default, each session tracks the changes made to all entities it has either stored, loaded, or queried for.  
  All changes are then persisted when `saveChanges` is called.

* Entity changes can be ignored for the `saveChanges` by disabling entity tracking.

* Tracking can be disabled by any of the following:
    * [Disable tracking a specific entity in session](../../../client-api/session/configuration/how-to-disable-tracking.mdx#disable-tracking-a-specific-entity-in-session)
    * [Disable tracking all entities in session](../../../client-api/session/configuration/how-to-disable-tracking.mdx#disable-tracking-all-entities-in-session)
    * [Disable tracking query results](../../../client-api/session/configuration/how-to-disable-tracking.mdx#disable-tracking-query-results)
    * [Customize tracking in conventions](../../../client-api/session/configuration/how-to-disable-tracking.mdx#customize-tracking-in-conventions)
</Admonition>
