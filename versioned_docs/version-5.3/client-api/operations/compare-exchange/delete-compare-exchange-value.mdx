<Admonition type="note" title="">

* Use `DeleteCompareExchangeValueOperation` to delete a _Key_ and its _Value_.  

* The _Key_ and its _Value_ are deleted only if the _index_ in the request matches the current index stored in the server for the specified key.  

* For an overview of the 'Compare Exchange' feature click: [Compare Exchange Overview](../../../client-api/operations/compare-exchange/overview.mdx)

* In this page:  
  * [Syntax](../../../client-api/operations/compare-exchange/get-compare-exchange-values.mdx#syntax)  
  * [Example](../../../client-api/operations/compare-exchange/delete-compare-exchange-value.mdx#example)

## Syntax

**Method**:
<TabItem value="delete_0" label="delete_0">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`public DeleteCompareExchangeValueOperation(string key, long index)
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

| Parameters | | |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| **key** | string | The key to be deleted |
| **index** | long |  The version number of the value to be deleted |

**Returned object**:
<TabItem value="compare_exchange_result" label="compare_exchange_result">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`public class CompareExchangeResult<T>
\{
    public bool Successful;
    public T Value;
    public long Index;
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

| Return Value | | |
| ------------- | ----- | ---- |
| **Successful** | bool | * _True_ if the delete operation was successfully completed
 * _True_ if _key_ doesn't exist
 * _False_ if the delete operation failed |  
| **Value** | `T` | * The value that was deleted upon a successful delete
* 'null' if _key_ doesn't exist
* The currently existing value on the server if delete operation failed |  
| **Index** | long | * The next available version number upon success
* The next available version number if _key_ doesn't exist
* The currently existing index on the server if the delete operation failed |  


## Example

<TabItem value="delete_1" label="delete_1">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`// First, get existing value
CompareExchangeValue<User> readResult =
    store.Operations.Send(
        new GetCompareExchangeValueOperation<User>("AdminUser"));

// Delete the key - use the index received from the 'Get' operation
CompareExchangeResult<User> deleteResult
    = store.Operations.Send(
        new DeleteCompareExchangeValueOperation<User>("AdminUser", readResult.Index));

// The delete result is successful only if the index has not changed between the read and delete operations
bool deleteResultSuccessful = deleteResult.Successful;
`}
