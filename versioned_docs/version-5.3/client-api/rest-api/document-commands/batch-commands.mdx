# Batch Commands
<Admonition type="note" title="">

* Use this endpoint with the **`POST`** method to send multiple commands in one request:  
`<server URL>/databases/<database name>/bulk_docs`  

* The commands are sent as a JSON array in the [request body](../../../client-api/rest-api/document-commands/batch-commands.mdx#body).  

* All the commands in the batch will either succeed or fail as a **single transaction**. Changes will not be visible until 
the entire batch completes.  

* [Options](../../../client-api/rest-api/document-commands/batch-commands.mdx#batch-options) can be set to make the server wait 
for indexing and replication to complete before returning.

## Basic Example

This is a cURL request to a database named "Example" on our [playground server](http://live-test.ravendb.net).  
It batches two commands:  

1. Upload a new document called "person/1".  
2. Execute a [patch](../../../client-api/operations/patching/single-document.mdx) on that same document.  

<TabItem value="bash" label="bash">
<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`curl -X POST "http://live-test.ravendb.net/databases/Example/bulk_docs"
-H "Content-Type: application/json"

            "Debug": null
        \}
    ]
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## Request Format

This is the general format of a cURL request with a batch of commands that _does not_ include a Put Attachment Command 
(see the format for batching a Put Attachment Command [below](../../../client-api/rest-api/document-commands/batch-commands.mdx#put-attachment-command)):  

<TabItem value="bash" label="bash">
<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`curl -X POST "<server URL>/databases/<database name>/bulk_docs?<batch options>"
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
-d "\{
    \\"Commands\\": [
        \{ <command> \},
        ...
    ]
\}"
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
Linebreaks are added for clarity.  


#### Query String

The query string takes [batch options](../../../client-api/rest-api/document-commands/batch-commands.mdx#batch-options), which 
can make the server wait for indexing and replication to finish before responding.  


#### Header

The header `Content-Type` is required and takes one of two values:  

* `application/json` - if the batch _does not_ include a Put Attachment Command.  
* `multipart/mixed; boundary=<separator>` - if the batch [_does_](../../../client-api/rest-api/document-commands/batch-commands.mdx#put-attachment-command) 
include a Put Attachment Command. The "separator" is an arbitrary string used to demarcate the attachment streams and 
commands array.  


#### Body

The body contains a JSON array of commands.  

<TabItem value="powershell" label="powershell">
<CodeBlock language="powershell">
{`-d "\{
    \\"Commands\\": [
        \{ 
            \\"Id\\": \\"<document ID>\\",
            ...
            \\"Type\\": \\"<command type>\\"
        \},
        \{ <command> \},
        ...
    ]
\}"
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
Depending on the shell you're using to run cURL, you will probably need to escape all double quotes within the request body 
using a backslash: `"` -&gt; `\"`.  

The following commands can be sent using the batch command:  

* [Put Document Command](../../../client-api/rest-api/document-commands/batch-commands.mdx#put-document-command)  
* [Patch Document Command](../../../client-api/rest-api/document-commands/batch-commands.mdx#patch-document-command)  
* [Delete Document Command](../../../client-api/rest-api/document-commands/batch-commands.mdx#delete-document-command)  
* [Delete by Prefix Command](../../../client-api/rest-api/document-commands/batch-commands.mdx#delete-by-prefix-command)  
* [Put Attachment Command](../../../client-api/rest-api/document-commands/batch-commands.mdx#put-attachment-command)  
* [Delete Attachment Command](../../../client-api/rest-api/document-commands/batch-commands.mdx#delete-attachment-command)  
### Batch Options

These options, configured in the query string, make the server wait until indexing or replication have completed before responding. If these have not 
completed before a specified amount of time has passed, the server can either respond as normal or throw an exception.  

This is the general format of a cURL request that includes batch options in the query string:

<TabItem value="html" label="html">
<CodeBlock language="html">
{`curl -X POST "<server_URL>/databases/<database_name>/bulk_docs?<batch option>=<value>
             &<batch option>=<value>
             &<batch option>=<value>
             ..."
-H "Content-Type: <content_type>"
-d "\{ \}"
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
Linebreaks are added for clarity.  


#### Indexing Options

| Query Parameter | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| **waitForIndexesTimeout** | `TimeSpan` | The amount of time to wait for indexing to complete. [Format of `TimeSpan`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.timespan). |
| **waitForIndexThrow** | `boolean` | Set to `true` to throw an exception if the indexing doesn't complete before `waitForIndexesTimeout`.
Set to `false` to recieve the normal response body. |
| **waitForSpecificIndex** | `string[]` | Wait only for the listed indexes to finish updating, rather than all indexes. |

#### Replication Options

| Query Parameter | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| **waitForReplicasTimeout** | `TimeSpan` | The amount of time to wait for replication to complete. [Format of `TimeSpan`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.timespan). |
| **throwOnTimeoutInWaitForReplicas** | `boolean` | Set to `true` to throw an exception if the replication doesn't complete before `waitForReplicasTimeout`.
Set to `false` to recieve the normal response body. |
| **numberOfReplicasToWaitFor** | `int`/`string` | The number of replicas that should be made before `waitForReplicasTimeout`. Set this parameter to `majority` to wait until the data has been replicated to a majority of the nodes in the database group. Default = `1`. |

## Commands

### Put Document Command

Upload a new document or update an existing document.  

Format within the `Commands` array in the [request body](../../../client-api/rest-api/document-commands/batch-commands.mdx#request-format):  

<TabItem value="powershell" label="powershell">
<CodeBlock language="powershell">
{`\{
    \\"Id\\": \\"<document ID>\\",
    \\"ChangeVector\\": \\"<expected change vector>\\",
    \\"Document\\": \{
        <document content>

    \\"ForceRevisionCreationStrategy\\": \\"Before\\"
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

| Parameter | Description | Required |
| - | - | - |
| **Id** | ID of document to create or update | Yes to update, [no to create](../../../client-api/document-identifiers/working-with-document-identifiers.mdx#autogenerated-ids) |
| **ChangeVector** | When updating an existing document, this parameter that document's expected [change vector](../../../server/clustering/replication/change-vector.mdx). If it does not match the server-side change vector a concurrency exception is thrown. 
An exception is also thrown if the document does not exist. | No |
| **Document** | JSON document to create, or to replace the existing document | Yes |
| **Type** | Set to `PUT` | Yes |
| **ForceRevisionCreationStrategy** | When updating an existing document, set to `Before` to make a [revision](../../../document-extensions/revisions/overview.mdx) of the document before it is updated. | No |
### Patch Document Command

Update a document. A [patch](../../../client-api/operations/patching/single-document.mdx) is executed on the server side and 
does not involve loading the document, avoiding the cost of sending the entire document in a round trip over the network.  

Format within the `Commands` array in the [request body](../../../client-api/rest-api/document-commands/batch-commands.mdx#request-format):  

<TabItem value="powershell" label="powershell">

\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

| Parameter | Description | Required |
| - | - | - |
| **Id** | ID of a document to execute the patch on | Yes |
| **ChangeVector** | The document's expected [change vector](../../../server/clustering/replication/change-vector.mdx). If it does not match the server-side change vector a concurrency exception is thrown. | No |

| **PatchIfMissing** | An alternative script to be executed if no document with the given ID is found. This will create a new document with the given ID. [Details below](../../../client-api/rest-api/document-commands/batch-commands.mdx#patch-request). | No |
| **Type** | Set to `PATCH` | Yes |

#### Patch Request

Using scripts with arguments allows RavenDB to cache scripts and boost performance. For cURL, use single quotes `'` to 
wrap strings.  

| Sub-Parameter | Description | Required |
| - | - | - |
| **Script** | Javascript commands to perform on the document. Use arguments from `Values` with a `$` prefix, i.e. `$<argument name>`. | Yes |
| **Values** | Arguments that can be used in the script. | No |
### Delete Document Command

Delete a document by its ID.  

Format within the `Commands` array in the [request body](../../../client-api/rest-api/document-commands/batch-commands.mdx#request-format):  

<TabItem value="powershell" label="powershell">
<CodeBlock language="powershell">

| **Type** | Set to `DELETE` | Yes |
### Put Attachment Command

Add an [attachment](../../../document-extensions/attachments/what-are-attachments.mdx) to a document, or update an existing attachment.  

If a batch contains a Put Attachment Command, the cURL format of the request is slightly different from a batch that doesn't.  
The `Content-Type` header takes `multipart/mixed; boundary="<separator>"` instead of the default `application/json`.  
The body contains the `Commands` array followed by each of the attachments, passed in the form of binary streams. The attachment streams come in the 
same order as their respective Put Attachment Commands within the `Commands` array. The `separator` demarcates these sections.  

The general form of a cURL request:  

<TabItem value="powershell" label="powershell">
<CodeBlock language="powershell">
{`curl -X POST "<server URL>/databases/<database name>/bulk_docs"
-H "Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=<separator>"

`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

| Parameter | Description | Required |

| **Id** | Document ID | Yes |
| **Name** | Name of attachment to create or update | Yes |
| **ContentType** | Mime type of the attachment | No |
| **ChangeVector** | The document's expected [change vector](../../../server/clustering/replication/change-vector.mdx). If it does not match the server-side change vector a concurrency exception is thrown. | No |
| **Type** | Set to `AttachmentPUT` | Yes |
