* When set, the `readBalanceBehavior` configuration will be in effect according to the   
  conditional flow described in [Client logic for choosing a node](../../../client-api/configuration/load-balance/overview.mdx#client-logic-for-choosing-a-node).

* Once configuration is in effect then:  
  * **_Read_** requests - will be sent to the node determined by the configured option - see below.
  * **_Write_** requests - are always sent to the preferred node.  
    The data will then be replicated to all the other nodes in the database group. 
  * Upon a node failure, the node to failover to is also determined by the defined option.

## readBalanceBehavior options 

<Admonition type="note" title="">

__`None`__ (default option)

  * __Read-balance__  
    No read balancing will occur.  
    The client will always send _Read_ requests to the [preferred node](../../../client-api/configuration/load-balance/overview.mdx#the-preferred-node).
  * __Failover__  
    The client will failover nodes in the order they appear in the [topology nodes list](../../../studio/database/settings/manage-database-group.mdx#database-group-topology---actions).

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="note" title="">

__`RoundRobin`__

* __Read-balance__
  * Each session opened is assigned an incremental session-id number.  
    __Per session__, the client will select the next node from the topology list based on this internal session-id.  
  * All _Read_ requests made on the session (i.e a query or a load request, etc.)  
    will address the calculated node.  
  * A _Read_ request that is made on the store (i.e. executing an [operation](../../../client-api/operations/what-are-operations.mdx))   
    will go to the preferred node.  
* __Failover__  
  In case of a failure, the client will try the next node from the topology nodes list.  

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="note" title="">

__`FastestNode`__  

  * __Read-balance__  
    All _Read_ requests will go to the fastest node.  
    The fastest node is determined by a [Speed Test](../../../client-api/cluster/speed-test.mdx).
  * __Failover__  
    In case of a failure, a speed test will be triggered again,  
    and in the meantime the client will use the preferred node.

## Initialize readBalanceBehavior on the client 

<Admonition type="note" title="">

* The `readBalanceBehavior` convention can be set __on the client__ when initializing the Document Store.  
  This will set the read balance behavior for the default database that is set on the store.  

* This setting can be __overriden__ by setting 'readBalanceBehavior' on the server, see [below](../../../client-api/configuration/load-balance/read-balance-behavior.mdx#set-readbalancebehavior-on-the-server).   

<TabItem value="readBalance_1" label="readBalance_1">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`// Initialize 'readBalanceBehavior' on the client: 
// ===============================================

const documentStore = new DocumentStore(["serverUrl_1", "serverUrl_2", "..."], "DefaultDB");

// For example:
// With readBalanceBehavior set to: 'FastestNode':
// Client READ requests will address the fastest node
// Client WRITE requests will address the preferred node
documentStore.conventions.readBalanceBehavior = "FastestNode";

documentStore.initialize();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

</Admonition>



## Set readBalanceBehavior on the server 

<Admonition type="note" title="">

<a id="setByOperation"/> __Set readBalanceBehavior on the server - by operation__ 
* The `readBalanceBehavior` configuration can be set __on the server__ by sending an [operation](../../../client-api/operations/what-are-operations.mdx).  

* The operation can modify the default database only, or all databases - see examples below.  

* Once configuration on the server has changed, the running client will get updated with the new settings.  
  See [keeping client up-to-date](../../../client-api/configuration/load-balance/overview.mdx#keeping-the-client-topology-up-to-date).  

<Tabs groupId='languageSyntax'>
<TabItem value="Operation_For_Default_Database" label="Operation_For_Default_Database">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`// Setting 'readBalanceBehavior' on the server by sending an operation:
// ====================================================================

// Define the client configuration to put on the server
const configurationToSave = {
    // Replace 'FastestNode' (from example above) with 'RoundRobin'
    readBalanceBehavior: "RoundRobin"
};

// Define the put configuration operation for the DEFAULT database
const putConfigurationOp = new PutClientConfigurationOperation(configurationToSave);

// Execute the operation by passing it to maintenance.send
await documentStore.maintenance.send(putConfigurationOp);

// After the operation has executed:
// All WRITE requests will continue to address the preferred node 
// READ requests, per session, will address a different node based on the RoundRobin logic

<Admonition type="note" title="">

<a id="setFromStudio"/> __Set readBalanceBehavior on the server - from Studio__
* The `readBalanceBehavior` configuration can be set from the Studio's [Client Configuration view](../../../studio/database/settings/client-configuration-per-database.mdx).  
  Setting it from the Studio will set this configuration directly __on the server__.  

* Once configuration on the server has changed, the running client will get updated with the new settings.  
  See [keeping client up-to-date](../../../client-api/configuration/load-balance/overview.mdx#keeping-the-client-topology-up-to-date).  

</Admonition>



## When to use 

* Setting the read balance behavior is beneficial when you only care about distributing the _Read_ requests among the cluster nodes,
  and when all _Write_ requests can go to the same node.

* Using the 'FastestNode' option is beneficial when some nodes in the system are known to be faster than others,
  thus letting the fastest node serve each read request.
