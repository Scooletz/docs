* Batches of documents sent from a Subscription Task defined on the server are 
  consumed and processed by a subscription worker client.  
* The `SubscripionWorker` object, which is defined on the client, manages the 
  communication between the server and the client and processes the documents 
  batches sent from the server.  
* There are several ways to create and configure the SubscriptionWorker - 
  see `SubscriptionWorkerOptions`.

## SubscriptionWorker lifecycle
A `SubscriptionWorker` object starts its life from being generated by the `DocumentsStore.Subscriptions`:

<TabItem value="subscription_open_simple" label="subscription_open_simple">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`subscriptionWorker = store.Subscriptions.GetSubscriptionWorker<Order>(subscriptionName);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

At this point, the worker has only got its configuration. No connection or processing happens at this moment. 
To start processing, the `Run` method should be called. The Run method receives the batch processing logic that should be performed:

<TabItem value="subscription_run_simple" label="subscription_run_simple">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`subscriptionRuntimeTask = subscriptionWorker.Run(batch =>
\{
    // your logic here
\});
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

From this point on, the subscription worker will start processing batches.  
If processing is aborted for any reason, the returned task (`subscriptionRuntimeTask`) 
will be finished with an exception.  




## Error handling
There are two categories of errors that may occur during subscription processing:

<Admonition type="info" title="Internal mechanism errors" id="internal-mechanism-errors" href="#internal-mechanism-errors">
Those errors occur during the normal server-client communication between the worker and the server.  
If an unexpected error occurs, the worker will try to reconnect to the server. There are conditions in which the worker will cease its operation and will not try to reconnect:  

* The subscription does not exist or was deleted  
* Another worker took over the subscription (see connection strategy)
* The worker could not connect to any of the servers
* The worker could not receive the node in charge of the task (this can happen when there is no leader)
* Authorization exception
* Exception during connection establishment

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info" title="User's batch processing logic unhandled exception" id="user-s-batch-processing-logic-unhandled-exception" href="#user-s-batch-processing-logic-unhandled-exception">
Example:
<TabItem value="throw_during_user_logic" label="throw_during_user_logic">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`_ = workerWBatch.Run(x => throw new Exception());
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

If an exception is thrown, the worker will abort the current batch process. 
A worker can be configured to treat the thrown exception in either of the following two ways:  

* By default, the worker will wrap the thrown exception with a `SubscriberErrorException` exception and rethrow it,  
  terminating the subscription execution without acknowledging progress or retrying. The task returned by the `Run` function will
  be terminated with an erroneous state, throwing a `SubscriberErrorException` exception.

* If `SubscriptionWorkerOptions`'s value `IgnoreSubscriberErrors` is set to true, the erroneous batch will get acknowledged without retrying and the next batches will continue processing. 
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info" title="Reconnecting" id="reconnecting" href="#reconnecting">
In the cases above, we described situations in which a worker will try to reconnect with the server. There are two key `SubscriptionWorkerOptions` fields controlling this state:

*  `TimeToWaitBeforeConnectionRetry` - The time that the worker will 'sleep' before trying to reconnect.
* `MaxErroneousPeriod` - The maximum time in which the worker is allowed to be in an erroneous state. After that time passes, the worker will stop trying to reconnect.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info" title="Timing out" id="timing-out" href="#timing-out">
A worker will time out after losing its connectivity with the server for a given time period.  

* The timeout period can be set using the `ConnectionStreamTimeout` option.  
  E.g. 
<TabItem value="worker_timeout_minimal_sample" label="worker_timeout_minimal_sample">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`var options = new SubscriptionWorkerOptions(subscriptionName);

// Set the worker's timeout period
options.ConnectionStreamTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(45);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
* Default timeout period: 30 second  
</Admonition>


<Admonition type="info" title="OnUnexpectedSubscriptionError" id="onunexpectedsubscriptionerror" href="#onunexpectedsubscriptionerror">
`OnUnexpectedSubscriptionError` is the event raised when a connection failure occurs 
between the subscription worker and the server and it throws an unexpected exception. 
When this occurs, the worker will automatically try to reconnect again. This event is 
useful for logging these unexpected exceptions.
</Admonition>



## Worker interplay

* Subscription workers are configured with a **strategy**, that determines whether 
  they can connect their subscription **concurrently**, or only one at a time.  
* If a one-at-a-time strategy is chosen, it also determines how the workers 
  interact with each other to resolve which will connect the subscription.  

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

The strategy is configured by the `SubscriptionWorkerOptions` `Strategy` field.  
The strategy field is the enum `SubscriptionOpeningStrategy`.  

| `SubscriptionOpeningStrategy` | |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `OpenIfFree` | Connect if no other worker is connected |
| `WaitForFree` | Wait for currently connected worker to disconnect |
| `TakeOver` | Take over the connection |
| `Concurrent` | Connect concurrently |

</Admonition>

## Available Worker Strategies
### One Worker Per Subscription Strategies 

The following three strategies allow only a **single worker to connect 
the subscription at any given time**, and determine what happens when one 
worker is connected and another tries to connect.  

* `SubscriptionOpeningStrategy.OpenIfFree`  
  The server will allow the worker to connect only if there is currently 
  no other connected worker.  
  If there is an existing connection, the incoming worker will throw a 
  `SubscriptionInUseException`.  
* `SubscriptionOpeningStrategy.WaitForFree`  
  If the worker currently cannot open the subscription because it is used 
  by another worker, it will wait for the previous worker to disconnect and 
  connect only then.  
  This is useful in worker failover scenarios, where there is one active 
  worker and another already waits to take its place.  
* `SubscriptionOpeningStrategy.TakeOver`  
  The server will allow an incoming connection to overthrow an existing one, 
  according to the existing connection strategy.  
   * If the existing connection **does not** have a `TakeOver` strategy:  
     The incoming connection will take over, causing the existing 
     connection to throw a `SubscriptionInUseException`.  
   * If the existing connection **has** a `TakeOver` strategy:  
     The incoming connection will throw a `SubscriptionInUseException` exception.  
### Concurrent Strategy 

* `SubscriptionOpeningStrategy.Concurrent`  
  Multiple workers of the same subscription are allowed to connect it simultaneously.  
  Read more about concurrent subscriptions [here](../../../client-api/data-subscriptions/concurrent-subscriptions.mdx).  



## Determining Which Workers a Subscription Will Serve

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">
The **strategy used by the first worker connecting to a subscription** will determine 
which additional workers this subscription will be able to serve until all worker connections
are dropped.  
</Admonition>

* A subscription that serves one or more [Concurrent](../../../client-api/data-subscriptions/consumption/how-to-consume-data-subscription.mdx#concurrent-strategy) 
  workers, **can serve only other concurrent workers** until all worker connections are dropped.  
  If a worker that uses a [One Worker Per Subscription](../../../client-api/data-subscriptions/consumption/how-to-consume-data-subscription.mdx#one-worker-per-subscription-strategies) 
  strategy attempts to connect it -  
   * The connection attempt will be rejected.  
   * `SubscriptionInUseException` will be thrown.  

* A subscription that serves a worker that uses a
  [One Worker Per Subscription](../../../client-api/data-subscriptions/consumption/how-to-consume-data-subscription.mdx#one-worker-per-subscription-strategies) 
  strategy, **cannot** serve 
  [Concurrent](../../../client-api/data-subscriptions/consumption/how-to-consume-data-subscription.mdx#concurrent-strategy) 
  workers until the worker's connection is dropped.  
  If a concurrent worker attempts to connect it -  
   * The connection attempt will be rejected.  
   * `SubscriptionInUseException` will be thrown.

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

Subscriptions are consumed by processing batches of documents received from the server. 
A `SubscriptionWorker` object manages the documents processing and the communication between the client and the server according to a set of configurations received upon it's creation. 
We've introduced several ways to create and configure a SubscriptionWorker, starting from just giving a subscription name, and ending with a detailed configuration object - `SubscriptionWorkerOptions`.

<TabItem value="subscription_open_simple" label="subscription_open_simple">

{`subscriptionWorker = store.subscriptions().getSubscriptionWorker(Order.class, subscriptionName);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

At this point, the worker has only got its configuration. No connection or processing happens at this moment. 
In order to start processing, the `run` method should be called. The `run` method receives the batch processing logic that should be performed:

`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

</Admonition>




## Workers interplay
There can only be one active subscription worker working on a subscription. 
Nevertheless, there are scenarios where it is required to interact between an existing subscription worker and one that tries to connect. 
This relationship and interoperation is configured by the `SubscriptionConnectionOptions` `Strategy` field.  
The strategy field is an enum, having the following values:  

* `OPEN_IF_FREE` - the server will allow the worker to connect only if there isn't any other currently connected workers.  
  If there is a existing connection, the incoming worker will throw a SubscriptionInUseException.  
* `WAIT_FOR_FREE` - If the client currently cannot open the subscription because it is used by another client, it will wait for the previous client to disconnect and only then will connect.  
  This is useful in client failover scenarios where there is one active client and another one already waiting to take its place.  
* `TAKE_OVER` - the server will allow an incoming connection to overthrow an existing one. It will behave according to the existing connection strategy:
  * The existing connection has a strategy that is not `TAKE_OVER`. In this case, the incoming connection will take over it causing the existing connection to throw a SubscriptionInUseException exception.  
  * The existing connection has a strategy that is `TAKE_OVER`. In this case, the incoming connection will throw a SubscriptionInUseException exception.
