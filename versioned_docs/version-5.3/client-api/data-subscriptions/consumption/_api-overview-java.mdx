## Subscription worker generation

Subscription worker generation is accessible through the `DocumentStore`'s `subscriptions()` method, of type `DocumentSubscriptions`:
<TabItem value="subscriptionWorkerGeneration" label="subscriptionWorkerGeneration">
<CodeBlock language="java">
{`SubscriptionWorker<ObjectNode> getSubscriptionWorker(SubscriptionWorkerOptions options);
SubscriptionWorker<ObjectNode> getSubscriptionWorker(SubscriptionWorkerOptions options, String database);

SubscriptionWorker<ObjectNode> getSubscriptionWorker(String subscriptionName);
SubscriptionWorker<ObjectNode> getSubscriptionWorker(String subscriptionName, String database);

<T> SubscriptionWorker<T> getSubscriptionWorker(Class<T> clazz, SubscriptionWorkerOptions options);
<T> SubscriptionWorker<T> getSubscriptionWorker(Class<T> clazz, SubscriptionWorkerOptions options, String database);

<T> SubscriptionWorker<T> getSubscriptionWorker(Class<T> clazz, String subscriptionName);
<T> SubscriptionWorker<T> getSubscriptionWorker(Class<T> clazz, String subscriptionName, String database);

<T> SubscriptionWorker<Revision<T>> getSubscriptionWorkerForRevisions(Class<T> clazz, SubscriptionWorkerOptions options);
<T> SubscriptionWorker<Revision<T>> getSubscriptionWorkerForRevisions(Class<T> clazz, SubscriptionWorkerOptions options, String database);

<T> SubscriptionWorker<Revision<T>> getSubscriptionWorkerForRevisions(Class<T> clazz, String subscriptionName);
<T> SubscriptionWorker<Revision<T>> getSubscriptionWorkerForRevisions(Class<T> clazz, String subscriptionName, String database);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

| Parameters | | |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| **subscriptionName** | `String` | The subscription's name. This parameter appears in more simple overloads allowing to start processing without creating a `SubscriptionCreationOptions` instance, relying on the default values |
| **options** | `SubscriptionWorkerOptions` | Contains subscription worker, affecting the interaction of the specific worker with the subscription, but does not affect the subscription's definition |
| **database** | `String` | Name of the database to look for the data subscription. If `null`, the default database configured in DocumentStore will be used. |

| Return value | |
| ------------- | ----- |
| `SubscriptionWorker` | A created data subscription worker. When returned, the worker is Idle and it will start working only when the `run` function is called. |




## SubscriptionWorkerOptions

<Admonition type="note" title="">
The only mandatory parameter for SubscriptionWorkerOptions creation is the subscription's name.
</Admonition>

| Member | Type | Description |
|--------|:-----|-------------| 
| **subscriptionName** | `String` | Returns the subscription name passed to the constructor. This name will be used by the server side to identify the subscription in question. |
| **timeToWaitBeforeConnectionRetry** | `Duration` | Time to wait before reconnecting, in the case of non-aborting failure during the subscription processing. Default: 5 seconds. |
| **ignoreSubscriberErrors** | `boolean` | If true, will not abort subscription processing if client code, passed to the `run` function, throws an unhandled exception. Default: false. |
| **strategy** | `SubscriptionOpeningStrategy`<br/>(enum) | Sets the way the server will treat current and/or other clients when they will try to connect. See [Workers interplay](how-to-consume-data-subscription#workers-interplay). Default: `OPEN_IF_FREE`. |
| **maxDocsPerBatch** | `int` | Maximum amount of documents that the server will try sending in a batch. If the server will not find "enough" documents, it won't wait and send the amount it found. Default: 4096. |
| **closeWhenNoDocsLeft** | `boolean` | If true, it performs an "ad-hoc" operation that processes all possible documents, until the server can't find any new documents to send. At that moment, the task returned by the `Run` function will fail and throw a `SubscriptionClosedException` exception. Default: false. |
| **sendBufferSizeInBytes** | `int` | The size in bytes of the TCP socket buffer used for _sending_ data. <br/>Default: 32,768 (32 KiB) |
| **receiveBufferSizeInBytes** | `int` | The size in bytes of the TCP socket buffer used for _receiving_ data. <br/>Default: 32,768 (32 KiB) |



## Running subscription worker

After receiving a subscription worker, the subscription worker is still not processing any documents. SubscriptionWorker's `run` function allows you to start processing worker operations.  
The `run` function receives the client-side code as a consumer that will process the received batches:

<TabItem value="subscriptionWorkerRunning" label="subscriptionWorkerRunning">
<CodeBlock language="java">
{`CompletableFuture<Void> run(Consumer<SubscriptionBatch<T>> processDocuments);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>


| Parameters | | |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| **processDocuments** | `Consumer<SubscriptionBatch<T>>` | Delegate for sync batches processing |

| Return value | |
| ------------- | ----- |
| `CompletableFuture<Void>` | Task that is alive as long as the subscription worker is processing or tries processing. If the processing is aborted, the future exits with an exception | 




## SubscriptionBatch&lt;T&gt;

| Member | Type | Description |
|--------|:-----|-------------| 
| **items** | `List<SubscriptionBatch<T>.Item>` | Batch's items list. |
| **numberOfItemsInBatch** | `int` | Amount of items in the batch. |

| Method Signature | Return value | Description |
|--------|:-------------|-------------|
| **openSession()** | `IDocumentSession` | New document session, that tracks all items and included items of the current batch. |


<Admonition type="note" title="Subscription Worker Connectivity" id="subscription-worker-connectivity" href="#subscription-worker-connectivity">

As long as there is no exception, the worker will continue addressing the same 
server that the first batch was received from.  
If the worker fails to reach that node, it will try to failover to another node 
from the session's topology list.  
The node that the worker succeeded connecting to, will inform the worker which 
node is currently responsible for data subscriptions.

<Admonition type="note" title="">
if T is `ObjectNode`, no deserialization will take place
</Admonition>

| Member | Type | Description |
|--------|:-----|-------------| 
| **result** | `T` | Current batch item. |
| **exceptionMessage** | `String` | Message of the exception thrown during current document processing in the server side. |
| **id** | `String` | Current batch item's underlying document ID. |
| **changeVector** | `String` | Current batch item's underlying document change vector of the current document. |
| **rawResult** | `ObjectNode` | Current batch item before serialization to `T`. |
| **rawMetadata** | `ObjectNode` | Current batch item's underlying document metadata. |
| **metadata** | `IMetadataDictionary` | Current batch item's underlying metadata values. |

## SubscriptionWorker&lt;T&gt;

<Admonition type="note" title="Methods" id="methods" href="#methods">

| Method Signature| Return Type | Description |
|--------|:-----|-------------| 
| **close()** | `void` | Aborts subscription worker operation ungracefully by waiting for the task returned by the `run` function to finish running. |
| **run (multiple overloads)** | `CompletableFuture<Void>` | Starts the subscription worker work of processing batches, receiving the batch processing delegates (see [above](../../../client-api/data-subscriptions/consumption/api-overview.mdx#running-subscription-worker)). |

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="note" title="Events" id="events" href="#events">

| Event | Type\Return type | Description |
|--------|:-----|-------------| 
| **addAfterAcknowledgmentListener** | `Consumer<SubscriptionBatch<T>>` (event) | Event that is risen after each the server acknowledges batch processing progress. |
| **onSubscriptionConnectionRetry** | `Consumer<Exception>` (event) | Event that is fired when the subscription worker tries to reconnect to the server after a failure. The event receives as a parameter the exception that interrupted the processing. |
| **onClosed** | `Consumer<SubscriptionWorker<T>>` (event) | Event that is fired after the subscription worker was disposed. |

| Member | Type\Return type | Description |
|--------|:-----|-------------| 
| **currentNodeTag** | `String` | Returns current processing RavenDB server's node tag. |
| **subscriptionName** | `String` | Returns processed subscription's name. |
