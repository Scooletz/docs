# The Read-Only Access Level
<Admonition type="note" title="">

* A [client certificate](../../../server/security/authentication/client-certificate-usage.mdx) with a User security clearance 
can grant different levels of access for different databases. These access levels are **Admin**, 
**Read/Write**, and **Read Only**.  

* The Read Only access level only allows you to read data from a database, but not to write data. 
You cannot update existing documents, change any configurations, define [ongoing tasks](../../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/general-info.mdx) 
or [static indexes](../../../indexes/creating-and-deploying.mdx#static-indexes). However, the database 
will still create [auto-indexes](../../../indexes/creating-and-deploying.mdx#auto-indexes) in response 
to the clients' queries.  

* Clients with Read Only access can still become [subscription workers](../../../client-api/data-subscriptions/what-are-data-subscriptions.mdx) 
to consume data subscriptions.  

* When in 'Read Only mode', there are various slight differences in the appearance of the Studio 
that make it clear to the user what they can and can't do.  

* In this page:  

  * [Create a Client Certificate with Read Only Access](../../../studio/server/certificates/read-only-access-level.mdx#create-a-client-certificate-with-read-only-access)
  * [The Studio in "Read Only" Mode](../../../studio/server/certificates/read-only-access-level.mdx#the-studio-in-"read-only"-mode)

## Create a Client Certificate with Read Only Access

![Certificates view](./assets/read-only-certificates-1.png)

<Admonition type="info" title="">

1. This view is found in `Manage Server` &gt; `Certificates`

2. This area lists the databases' names, and the access level for each one:  
  * **&lt;span style="color:chartreuse"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;** - Admin
  * **&lt;span style="color:orange"&gt;R/W&lt;/span&gt;** - Read/Write
  * **&lt;span style="color:lightcoral"&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;** - Read Only

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="warning" title="">

1. This drop-down menu allows you to either generate a new client certificate, or upload 
your own. This will open the Generate/Upload Client Certificate dialog you see on the 
right.  

2. Enter the certificate's name.  

3. Select the security clearance. Only the User clearance can have a Read Only access level 
for a given database. The options are:
  * Cluster Administrator
  * Operator
  * User

4. Certificate passphrase - a password that needs to be entered each time someone installs 
this certificate.  

5. You can set a custom expiration date for this certificate. This is defined in terms of 
months from the current date. Default: 60 months, or 5 years.  

6. Choose the database permissions (the access level) for each database. If a given 
database is not added to this list, the certificate will grant no access to that database 
_at all._  

7. Click this to edit a certificate. The name, security clearance level, expiration date, 
and database permissions can all be modified.

## The Studio in Read Only Mode

This section shows the slight variations in the studio that tell you which security 
clearance and which access level you currently have, and what you can or can't do.  

![RavenDB Studio view](./assets/read-only-certificates-2.png)

<Admonition type="info" title="">

1. This dropdown menu allows you to choose a database to view. Access levels are indicated 
on the right.  

2. Hover on the green padlock icon at the bottom of the screen to view information about 
the certificate your browser is using to access the server.  

</Admonition>  

![Manage Server view](./assets/read-only-certificates-3.png)

<Admonition type="info" title="">

When using a certificate with **Security Clearance "User"**, most of the views that pertain 
to the server (in the "Manage Server" menu), are inaccessible.  

Note: this is always true for any certificate with security clearance User - even with 
the **Admin** and **Read/Write** access levels.  

The Manage Server views that can be accessed with a User security clearance are:  

* The [Cluster View](../../../studio/cluster/cluster-view.mdx), where info about the 
cluster topology can be viewed.  
* The Running Queries view, a live display of queries the server is currently processing.  

</Admonition>

![Tasks and Settings views](./assets/read-only-certificates-4.png)

<Admonition type="info" title="">

This split image shows which views that pertain to a specific database are restricted in Read 
Only mode.  

* On the left we see the database "Tasks" menu. "Import Data" and "Create Sample Data" are 
restricted.  
* On the right we see the database "Settings" menu. Only one view - "Connection Strings" - is 
restriced.  

</Admonition>

![Indexes view](./assets/read-only-certificates-5.png)

<Admonition type="info" title="">

This split image compares the same index in the "Indexes" view in Read Only mode versus other 
modes.  

* At the top we see the index in the normal viewing mode ( _not_ Read Only). There are three 
buttons at the top right:  
1) Edit - view & edit the index definition.  
2) Reset index - force the index to start re-indexing all of its data.  
3) Remove - delete the index.  

* At the bottom we see the same index in Read Only mode. In the same spot we now see only one 
button:  
4) This is the "viewing" button. It opens the exact same view as the above "editing" 
button, except you cannot modify the index. Reseting or deleting the index are not possible 
in Read Only mode.  

This "viewing" button replaces the "editing" button in other parts of the Studio as well.
