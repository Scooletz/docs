# Subscription Task
<Admonition type="note" title="">

* A **Data Subscription** is a task that automatically sends certain documents to a subscribed 
  client, called the "subscription worker".  

* This page explains how to create a subscription task on the server side using the Studio.  

* In this page:
  * [Subscription Task Definition](../../../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/subscription-task.mdx#subscription-task-definition)
  * [Testing Subscriptions](../../../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/subscription-task.mdx#testing)
  * [Details in Task List View](../../../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/subscription-task.mdx#details-in-task-list-view)

## Subscription Task Definition

![Figure 1. Subscription Task Definition](./assets/subscriptions-1.png)

1. The RQL query that selects which documents the subscription sends 
   to the client.  

2. Define the starting point from which to send the first batch:  
   * **Begining of Time** (default option)  
     All documents matching the RQL query will be sent, regardless of their creation time.  
   * **Latest Document**  
     Start from the first new document that will be created after the subscription is created.  
   * **Change Vector**  
     Specify a document change vector as the subscription starting point.  

3. Choose which node will perform this task by default.  

4. Test the subscription query.  



## Testing

![Figure 2. Testing Subscription](./assets/subscriptions-2.png)

Testing the subscription shows which documents match the specified query.  

1. Limit the number of results to retrieve for this test.  

2. Limit how long - in seconds - the test should continue before 
stopping automatically.  

3. Run the test.  



## Details in Task List View

![Figure 3. Task List View](./assets/subscriptions-3.png)

Click the info button on a task in the task list view, to see 
more detailed information.  

1. Task Details Panel  
   * Task status -  
     **Active**: status is `Active` while a subscription worker is connected to the task.  
     **Not active**: status is `Not-active` when no workers are connected.  
   * Mode -  
     **Single**: mode is `Single` if the 
     [subscription strategy](../../../../client-api/data-subscriptions/consumption/how-to-consume-data-subscription.mdx#determining-which-workers-a-subscription-will-serve) 
     allows only one worker to be connected at a time.  
     **Concurrent**: mode is `Concurrent` if the subscription strategy allows only workers 
     that use the `Concurrent` strategy to connect.  
   * Client URI - the identifier of the subscription worker 
     subscribed to this task.  
   * Connection strategy - determines the workers connection strategy.  
   * Change vector for next batch - the change vector of the last document 
     that was sent in the last batch.  
   * Last batch acknowledgement time - the last time a worker 
     responded that it has received a batch.  
   * Last client connection time - the last time a worker communicated 
     with or pinged the server.

### Concurrent Subscriptions

When [Concurrent Subscribers](../../../../client-api/data-subscriptions/concurrent-subscriptions.mdx) 
are connected to a subscription task, they are all listed on the task details panel.

1. Each concurrent subscriber can be disconnected individually.  
2. Refresh the view to see changes in workers connection states.
