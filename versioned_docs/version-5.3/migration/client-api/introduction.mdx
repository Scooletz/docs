# Migration: Introduction to 4.x to 5.0 Migration

<Admonition type="note" title="Migration from RavenDB 3.x" id="migration-from-ravendb-3-x" href="#migration-from-ravendb-3-x">

If you are interested in migrating Client API from earlier version please visit our dedicated [article](https://ravendb.net/docs/article-page/4.2/csharp/migration/client-api/introduction). Current article focuses only on differences between 4.x and 5.0 version of RavenDB Client API.

</Admonition>

This section of the documentation discusses differences between 4.x and 5.0 Client API and focuses on giving guides how to finalize the process in as few steps as possible. The major set of changes is related to the introduction of abstract layer over JSON serialization. The changes are relatively small when it comes to migration, but still require few actions like namespace adjustments or document conventions reconfiguration.

## Conventions

Please refer to our dedicated conventions migration article available [here](../../migration/client-api/conventions.mdx).
