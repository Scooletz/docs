## Overview

<Admonition type="note" title="">

<a id="why-include"/> **Why include revisions**:
* Including revisions may be useful, for example, when an auditing application loads or queries for a document.  
  The document's past revisions can be included with the document to make the document's history available for instant inspection.  

* Once loaded to the session, there are no additional trips to the server when accessing the revisions.  
  [Getting](../../../../document-extensions/revisions/client-api/session/loading.mdx) a revision that was included with the document will retrieve it directly from the session.  
  This also holds true when attempting to include revisions but none are found.

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="note" title="">

<a id="include-by-time"/> **Including by Creation Time**:
* You can include a single revision by specifying its creation time, see examples below.

* You can pass local time or UTC, either way the server will  convert it to UTC.  

* **If the provided time matches** the creation time of a document revision, this revision will be included.

* **If no exact match is found**, then the first revision that precedes the specified time will be returned.

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="note" title="">

<a id="include-by-change-vector"/> **Including by Change Vector**:
* Each time a document is modified, its [Change Vector](../../../../server/clustering/replication/change-vector.mdx) is updated.  

* When a revision is created,  
  the revision's change vector is the change vector of the document at the time of the revision's creation.  

* To include single or multiple document revisions by their change vectors:   

  * When modifying the document, store its updated change vector in a property in the document.  
    Can be done by [patching](../../../../document-extensions/revisions/client-api/session/including.mdx#patching-the-revision-change-vector) the document from the Client API or from the Studio.

  * Specify the **path** to this property when including the revisions, see examples below.  
  
  * e.g.:  
    Each time an employee's contract document is modified (e.g. when their salary is raised),  
    you can add the current change vector of the document to a dedicated property in the document.  
    Whenever the time comes to re-evaluate an employee's terms and their contract is loaded,  
    its past revisions can be easily included with it by their change vectors.

## Include revisions when Loading document

**Include a revision by Time**

<TabItem value="include_1" label="include_1">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`// The revision creation time
// For example - looking for a revision from last month
const creationTime = new Date();
creationTime.setMonth(creationTime.getMonth() - 1).toLocaleString();

// Load a document:
const order = await session.load("orders/1-A", \{
    // Pass the revision creation time to 'includeRevisions'
    // The revision will be 'loaded' to the session along with the document
    includes: builder => builder.includeRevisions(creationTime)
\});

// Get the revision by creation time - it will be retrieved from the SESSION
// No additional trip to the server is made
const revision = await session
    .advanced.revisions.get("orders/1-A", creationTime);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
**Include revisions by Change Vector**

<TabItem value="include_2" label="include_2">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`// Load a document:
const contract = await session.load("contracts/1-A", \{
    includes: builder => builder
        // Pass the path to the document property that contains the revision change vector(s)
        // The revision(s) will be 'loaded' to the session along with the document
        .includeRevisions("revisionChangeVector")  // Include a single revision
        .includeRevisions("revisionChangeVectors") // Include multiple revisions

## Include revisions when making a Query

**Include revisions by Time**

<TabItem value="include_3" label="include_3">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`// The revision creation time
// For example - looking for a revision from last month
const creationTime = new Date();
creationTime.setMonth(creationTime.getMonth() - 1).toLocaleString();

    .whereEquals("ShipTo.Country", "Canada")
    // Pass the revision creation time to 'includeRevisions'
    .include(builder => builder.includeRevisions(creationTime));

// Execute the query:
// For each document in the query results,
// the matching revision will be 'loaded' to the session along with the document
const orderDocuments = await query.all();

// Get a revision by its creation time for a document from the query results
// It will be retrieved from the SESSION - no additional trip to the server is made
const revision = await session
    .advanced.revisions.get(orderDocuments[0].id, creationTime);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
**Include revisions by Change Vector**

<TabItem value="include_4" label="include_4">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`// Define the query:
const query = session.query(\{collection: "Contracts"\})
    // Pass the path to the document property that contains the revision change vector(s)

`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

* See the _Contract_ class definition [above](../../../../document-extensions/revisions/client-api/session/including.mdx#sample-document). 



## Include revisions when making a Raw Query

* Use `include revisions` in your RQL when making a raw query.  

* Pass either the revision creation time or the path to the document property containing the change vector(s),  
  RavenDB will figure out the parameter type passed and include the revisions accordingly.    

* Aliases (e.g. `from Users as U`) are Not supported by raw queries that include revisions.
**Include revisions by Time**

<TabItem value="include_5" label="include_5">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`// The revision creation time

// Define the Raw Query:
const rawQuery = session.advanced
    // Use 'include revisions' in the RQL
    .rawQuery("from Orders include revisions($p0)")
    // Pass the revision creation time 
    .addParameter("p0", creationTime);

// Execute the query:
// For each document in the query results,

## Syntax

<TabItem value="syntax" label="syntax">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`object includeRevisions(before);
object includeRevisions(path);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

| Parameters | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| **before** | `string` | &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creation time of the revision to be included.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pass local time or UTC.<br/>The server will convert the param to UTC.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If no revision was created at this time then the first revision that precedes it is returned.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; |
| **path** | `string` | &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The path to the document property that contains <br/> **a single change vector** or **an array of change vectors** <br/>of the revisions to be included.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; |

| Return value | |
| - | - |
| `object` | &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When **loading** a document:<br/>A builder object that is used to build the include part in the Load request.&lt;/il&gt;&lt;li&gt;When **querying** for a document:<br/>A builder object that is used to build the include part in the Query RQL expression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can be used in chaining.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; |



## Patching the revision change vector

* To include revisions when making a query or a raw query,  
  you need to specify the path to the document property that contains the revision change vector(s).

* The below example shows how to get and patch a revision change vector to a document property.

<TabItem value="include_7" label="include_7">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`// Get the revisions' metadata for document 'contracts/1-A'
const contractRevisionsMetadata = await session
    .advanced.revisions.getMetadataFor("contracts/1-A");

// Get a change vector from the metadata
const metadata = orderRevisionsMetadata[0];
const changeVector = metadata[CONSTANTS.Documents.Metadata.CHANGE_VECTOR];

// Patch the document - add the revision change vector to a specific document property
await session.advanced.patch("contracts/1-A", "revisionChangeVector", changeVector);

// Save your changes
await session.saveChanges();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

* See the _Contract_ class definition [above](../../../../document-extensions/revisions/client-api/session/including.mdx#sample-document).
