# Session: How to Change Maximum Number of Requests per Session
<LanguageSwitcher supportedLanguages={supportedLanguages} />
<LanguageContent language="csharp">


By default, the maximum number of requests that a session can send the server is **30**.  
This number, if everything is done correctly, should never be reached since remote 
calls are expensive and the number of remote calls per "session" should be as close 
to **1** as possible.  
If the limit is reached, it may indicate a `Select N+1` problem or some other misuse 
of the session object.

Nevertheless, if needed, this number can be changed for a single session or for all sessions.

## Single session

To change the maximum number of requests in a single session, modify the `MaxNumberOfRequestsPerSession` 
property value using the `Advanced` session operations.

<TabItem value="max_requests_1" label="max_requests_1">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`session.Advanced.MaxNumberOfRequestsPerSession = 50;
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

## All sessions

To change the maximum number of requests for **all** sessions (on a particular store), 
the `MaxNumberOfRequestsPerSession` property from DocumentStore `Conventions` must be changed.

<TabItem value="max_requests_2" label="max_requests_2">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`store.Conventions.MaxNumberOfRequestsPerSession = 100;
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

<Admonition type="info" title="Injecting MaxNumberOfRequestsPerSession from the Server" id="injecting-maxnumberofrequestspersession-from-the-server" href="#injecting-maxnumberofrequestspersession-from-the-server">
The maximum number of requests for all sessions can also be configured via injected client 
configuration from the Server. Read more about this [here](../../../studio/server/client-configuration.mdx).
