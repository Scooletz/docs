By default, the maximum number of requests that a session can send the server is **30**.  
This number, if everything is done correctly, should never be reached since remote 
calls are expensive and the number of remote calls per "session" should be as close 
to **1** as possible.  
If the limit is reached, it may indicate a `Select N+1` problem or some other misuse 
of the session object.

Nevertheless, if needed, this number can be changed for a single session or for all sessions.

## Single session

To change the maximum number of requests for a **single** session, modify the value 
of the `session` `_max_number_of_requests_per_session` property.

<TabItem value="max_requests_1" label="max_requests_1">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`session._max_number_of_requests_per_session = 50
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

## All sessions

To change the maximum number of requests for **all** sessions (on a particular store), 
change the value of the DocumentStore `conventions` `max_number_of_requests_per_session ` property.

<TabItem value="max_requests_2" label="max_requests_2">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`store.conventions.max_number_of_requests_per_session = 100
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

The maximum number of requests for all sessions can also be configured by via injected client 
configuration from the Server. Read more about this [here](../../../studio/server/client-configuration.mdx).
