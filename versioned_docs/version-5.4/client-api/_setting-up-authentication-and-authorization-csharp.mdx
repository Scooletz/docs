* **Authentication and authorization** are based on [Client X.509 Certificates](../server/security/authorization/security-clearance-and-permissions.mdx).  

* When your RavenDB instance runs on HTTPS, the server has a **Server Certificate** loaded.  
Your application must use a **Client Certificate** in order to access this secure server.  

* Obtain a Client Certificate from your cluster admin.  
The Client Certificate is generated by the admin from the [Studio](../server/security/authentication/certificate-management.mdx).  

* The security clearance (authorization level) for the generated Client Certificate is set during the process of generating the 
certificate.  

* Pass your Client Certificate to the Document Store before initialization, as shown in the example code 
[below](../client-api/setting-up-authentication-and-authorization.mdx#example---initializing-document-store-with-a-client-certificate).  
The server will use this certificate to authenticate the client when connection is established.

## Example - Initializing Document Store With a Client Certificate

<TabItem value="client_cert" label="client_cert">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`// Load a X.509 certificate
X509Certificate2 clientCertificate = new X509Certificate2("C:\\\\path_to_your_pfx_file\\\\cert.pfx");

using (IDocumentStore store = new DocumentStore()
\{
    // Pass your certificate to the \`Certificate\` property
    Certificate = clientCertificate,
    Database = "your_database_name",
    Urls = new[] \{"https://your_RavenDB_server_URL"\}
\}.Initialize())
