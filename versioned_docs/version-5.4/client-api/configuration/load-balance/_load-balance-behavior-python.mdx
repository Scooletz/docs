* The `loadBalanceBehavior` configuration allows you to specify which sessions should 
  communicate with the same node.  
 
* Sessions that are assigned the **same context** will have all their _Read_ & _Write_ 
  requests routed to the **same node**. Gain load balancing by assigning **different contexts** 
  to **different sessions**.

## LoadBalanceBehavior options 

### `None` (default option)

* Requests will be handled based on the `ReadBalanceBehavior` configuration.  
  See the conditional flow described in [Client logic for choosing a node](../../../client-api/configuration/load-balance/overview.mdx#client-logic-for-choosing-a-node).  
   * **_Read_** requests:  
     The client will calculate the target node from the configured [ReadBalanceBehavior Option](../../../client-api/configuration/load-balance/read-balance-behavior.mdx#readbalancebehavior-options).  
   * **_Write_** requests:  
     Will be sent to the [preferred node](../../../client-api/configuration/load-balance/overview.mdx#the-preferred-node).  
     The data will then be replicated to all the other nodes in the database group.
### `UseSessionContext`

* **Load-balance**

  * When this option is enabled, the client will calculate the target node from the session-id.  
    The session-id is hashed from a **context string** and an optional **seed** given by the user.  
    The context string together with the seed are referred to as **"The session context"**.
  
  * Per session, the client will select a node from the topology list based on this session-context.  
    So sessions that use the **same** context will target the **same** node.
  
  * All **_Read & Write_** requests made on the session (i.e a query or a load request, etc.)  
    will address this calculated node.  
    _Read & Write_ requests that are made on the store (i.e. executing an [operation](../../../client-api/operations/what-are-operations.mdx))  
    will go to the preferred node.

  * All _Write_ requests will be replicated to all the other nodes in the database group as usual.

* **Failover**  

  * In case of a failure, the client will try to access the next node from the topology nodes list.



## Initialize LoadBalanceBehavior on the client 

* The `LoadBalanceBehavior` convention can be set **on the client** when initializing the Document Store.  
  This will set the load balance behavior for the default database that is set on the store.

* This setting can be **overriden** by setting 'LoadBalanceBehavior' on the server, see [below](../../../client-api/configuration/load-balance/load-balance-behavior.mdx#set-loadbalancebehavior-on-the-server).
**Initialize conventions**:

<TabItem value="LoadBalance_1" label="LoadBalance_1">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`# Initialize 'LoadBalanceBehavior' on the client:
document_store = DocumentStore(
    urls=["ServerURL_1", "ServerURL_2", "..."],
    database="DefaultDB",
)
conventions = DocumentConventions()

# Enable the session-context feature
# If this is not enabled then a context string set in a session will be ignored
conventions.load_balance_behavior = LoadBalanceBehavior.USE_SESSION_CONTEXT

# Assign a method that sets the default context string
# This string will be used for sessions that do Not provide a context string
# A sample GetDefaultContext method is defined below
conventions.load_balancer_per_session_context_selector = get_default_context

# Set a seed
# The seed is 0 by default, provide any number to override
conventions.load_balancer_context_seed = 5

document_store.conventions = conventions
document_store.initialize()
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="LoadBalance_6" label="LoadBalance_6">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`# A customized method for getting a default context string
def get_default_context(self, db_name: str) -> str:
    # Method is invoked by RavenDB with the database name
    # Use that name - or return any string of your choice
    return "DefaultContextString"
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
**Session usage**:

<TabItem value="LoadBalance_2" label="LoadBalance_2">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`# Open a session that will use the DEFAULT store values:
with document_store.open_session() as session:
    # For all Read & Write requests made in this session
    # node to access is calculated from string & seed values defined on the store
    employee = session.load("employees/1-A", Employee)
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="LoadBalance_3" label="LoadBalance_3">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`# Open a session that will use a UNIQUE context string:
with document_store.open_session() as session:
    # Call context, pass a unique context string for this session
    session.advanced.session_info.context = "SomeOtherContext"

    # For all Read & Write requests made in this session,
    # node to access is calculated from the unique string & the seed defined on the store
    employee = session.load("employees/1-A", Employee)
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## Set LoadBalanceBehavior on the server 

<Admonition type="note" title="">

**Note**:  

* Setting the load balance behavior on the server, either by an **Operation** or from the **Studio**,  
  only 'enables the feature' and sets the seed.

* For the feature to be in effect, you still need to define the context string itself:  
  * either per session, call `session.advanced.session_info.context`  
  * or, on the document store, set a default value for - `load_balancer_per_session_context_selector`  

</Admonition>
#### Set LoadBalanceBehavior on the server - by operation:

* The `LoadBalanceBehavior` configuration can be set **on the server** by sending an [operation](../../../client-api/operations/what-are-operations.mdx).

* The operation can modify the default database only, or all databases - see examples below.

* Once configuration on the server has changed, the running client will get updated with the new settings.  
  See [keeping client up-to-date](../../../client-api/configuration/load-balance/overview.mdx#keeping-the-client-topology-up-to-date).

#### Set LoadBalanceBehavior on the server - from Studio:

* The `LoadBalanceBehavior` configuration can be set from the Studio's [Client Configuration view](../../../studio/database/settings/client-configuration-per-database.mdx).  
  Setting it from the Studio will set this configuration directly **on the server**.

* Once configuration on the server has changed, the running client will get updated with the new settings.  
  See [keeping client up-to-date](../../../client-api/configuration/load-balance/overview.mdx#keeping-the-client-topology-up-to-date).



## When to use 

* Distributing _Read & Write_ requests among the cluster nodes can be beneficial  
  when a set of sessions handle a specific set of documents or similar data.  
  Load balancing can be achieved by routing requests from the sessions that handle similar topics to the same node, while routing other sessions to other nodes.  
 
* Another usage example can be setting the session's context to be the current user.  
  Thus spreading the _Read & Write_ requests per user that logs into the application.  

* Once setting the load balance to be per session-context,  
  in the case when detecting that many or all sessions send requests to the same node,  
  a further level of node randomization can be added by changing the seed.
