* Use `DeleteByQueryOperation` to delete a large number of documents that match the provided query in a single server call.

* **Dynamic behavior**:   
  The deletion of documents matching the specified query is performed in batches of size 1024.  
  During the deletion process, documents that are added/modified **after** the delete operation has started  
  may also be deleted if they match the query criteria.

* **Background operation**:  
  This operation is performed in the background on the server.  
  If needed, you can wait for the operation to complete. See: [Wait for completion](../../../client-api/operations/what-are-operations.mdx#wait-for-completion).

* **Operation scope**:  
  `DeleteByQueryOperation` runs as a single-node transaction, not a cluster-wide transaction. As a result,  
  if you use this operation to delete documents that were originally created using a cluster-wide transaction,  
  their associated [Atomic guards](../../../client-api/session/cluster-transaction/atomic-guards.mdx) will Not be deleted.

  * To avoid issues when recreating such documents using a cluster-wide session, 
    see [Best practice when storing a document](../../../client-api/session/cluster-transaction/atomic-guards.mdx#best-practice-when-storing-a-document-in-a-cluster-wide-transaction).
  * To learn more about the differences between transaction types,
    see [Cluster-wide transaction vs. Single-node transaction](../../../client-api/session/cluster-transaction/overview.mdx#cluster-wide-transaction-vs-single-node-transaction).

## Delete by index query

* `DeleteByQueryOperation` can only be performed on a **Map-index**.  
  An exception is thrown when executing the operation on a Map-Reduce index.  

* A few overloads are available, see the following examples:
<Admonition type="note" title="">

##### A sample Map-index

    \}
    
    public Products_ByPrice()
    \{

            select new IndexEntry
