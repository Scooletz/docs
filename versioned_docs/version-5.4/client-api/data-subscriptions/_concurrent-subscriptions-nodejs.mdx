* With **Concurrent Subscriptions**, multiple data subscription workers can connect to the same subscription task simultaneously.

* Each worker is assigned a different batch of documents to process.

* By processing different batches in parallel, multiple workers can significantly accelerate the consumption of the subscription's contents.

* Documents that were assigned to workers whose connection has ended unexpectedly,  
  can be reassigned by the server to available workers. 
  See [connection failure](../../client-api/data-subscriptions/concurrent-subscriptions.mdx#connection-failure) below.

## Defining concurrent workers

Concurrent workers are defined similarly to other workers, except their 
[strategy](../../client-api/data-subscriptions/consumption/how-to-consume-data-subscription.mdx#worker-strategies) 
is set to [Concurrent](../../client-api/data-subscriptions/consumption/how-to-consume-data-subscription.mdx#multiple-workers-per-subscription-strategy).  

* To define a concurrent worker:  
   * Create the worker using [getSubscriptionWorker](../../client-api/data-subscriptions/consumption/api-overview.mdx#create-the-subscription-worker).  
   * Pass it a [subscription worker options](../../client-api/data-subscriptions/consumption/api-overview.mdx#subscription-worker-options) object.  
   * Set the strategy to `Concurrent`  

* Usage:  
   * Define two concurrent workers  
<TabItem value="concurrent_1" label="concurrent_1">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`// Define 2 concurrent subscription workers
// ========================================

const options = \{
    // Set concurrent strategy
    strategy: "Concurrent", 
    subscriptionName: "Get all orders",
    maxDocsPerBatch: 20
\};

const worker1 = documentStore.subscriptions.getSubscriptionWorker(options);
const worker2 = documentStore.subscriptions.getSubscriptionWorker(options);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
   * Run both workers  
<TabItem value="concurrent_2" label="concurrent_2">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`worker1.on("batch", (batch, callback) => \{
    try \{
        for (const item of batch.items) \{
            // Process item
        \}
        callback();

    \} catch(err) \{
        callback(err);
    \}
\});

worker2.on("batch", (batch, callback) => \{
    try \{
        for (const item of batch.items) \{
            // Process item
        \}
        callback();

    \} catch(err) \{
        callback(err);
    \}
\});
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## Dropping a connection

* Use `dropSubscriptionWorker` to **forcefully disconnect**
  the specified worker from the subscription it is connected to.

* Use `dropConnection` to disconnect ALL workers connected to the specified subscription.

<TabItem value="concurrent_3" label="concurrent_3">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`// Drop connection for worker2
await documentStore.subscriptions.dropSubscriptionWorker(worker2);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="drop_syntax" label="drop_syntax">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`// Available overloads:
dropConnection(options);
dropConnection(options, database);
dropSubscriptionWorker(worker);
dropSubscriptionWorker(worker, database);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## Connection failure

* When a concurrent worker's connection ends unexpectedly, 
  the server may reassign the documents this worker has been processing to any other concurrent worker that is available.  
* A worker that reconnects after a connection failure will be assigned a **new** batch of documents.  
  It is **not** guaranteed that the new batch will contain the same documents this worker was processing before the disconnection.
* As a result, documents may be processed more than once:  
  - first by a worker that disconnected unexpectedly without acknowledging the completion of its assigned documents, 
  - and later by other workers the documents are reassigned to.
