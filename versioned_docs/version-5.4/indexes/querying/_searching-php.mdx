* Prior to reading this article, please refer to [full-Text search with dynamic queries](../../client-api/session/querying/text-search/full-text-search.mdx) 
  to learn about the `search` method.  

* **All capabilities** provided by `search` with a dynamic query can also be used when querying a static-index.

* However, as opposed to making a dynamic search query where an auto-index is created for you,  
  when using a **static-index**:  

    * You must configure the index-field in which you want to search.  
      See examples below.  
      
    * You can configure which analyzer will be used to tokenize this field.  
      See [selecting an analyzer](../../indexes/using-analyzers.mdx#selecting-an-analyzer-for-a-field).    
* In this page:
  * [Indexing single field for FTS](../../indexes/querying/searching.mdx#indexing-single-field-for-fts)
  * [Indexing multiple fields for FTS](../../indexes/querying/searching.mdx#indexing-multiple-fields-for-fts)
  * [Boosting search results](../../indexes/querying/searching.mdx#boosting-search-results)

## Indexing single field for FTS

#### The index:

<TabItem value="index_1" label="index_1">
<CodeBlock language="php">
{`// The IndexEntry class defines the index-fields
class Employees_ByNotes_IndexEntry
\{
    private ?string $employeeNotes = null;

    public function getEmployeeNotes(): ?string
    \{
        return $this->employeeNotes;
    \}

    public function setEmployeeNotes(?string $employeeNotes): void
    \{
        $this->employeeNotes = $employeeNotes;
    \}
\}
class Employees_ByNotes extends AbstractIndexCreationTask
\{
    public function __construct()
    \{
        parent::__construct();

        // The 'Map' function defines the content of the index-fields
        $this->map =
            "from employee in docs.Employees " .
            "select new " .
            "\{ " .
               " employee_notes = employee.Notes[0]" .
            "\}";

        # Configure the index-field for FTS:
        # Set 'FieldIndexing.Search' on index-field 'employee_notes'
        $this->index("employee_notes", FieldIndexing::search());

        # Optionally: Set your choice of analyzer for the index-field:
        # Here the text from index-field 'EmployeeNotes' will be tokenized by 'WhitespaceAnalyzer'.
        $this->analyze("employee_notes", "WhitespaceAnalyzer");

        # Note:
        # If no analyzer is set then the default 'RavenStandardAnalyzer' is used.
    \}
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
#### Query with Search:

* Use `search` to make a full-text search when querying the index.  

* Refer to [Full-Text search with dynamic queries](../../client-api/session/querying/text-search/full-text-search.mdx) for all available **Search options**,  
  such as using wildcards, searching for multiple terms, etc.

     // pass the index field that was configured for FTS and the term to search for.
    ->search("EmployeeNotes", "French")
    ->ofType(Employee::class)
    ->toList();

// * Results will contain all Employee documents that have 'French' in their 'Notes' field.
//
// * Search is case-sensitive since field was indexed using the 'WhitespaceAnalyzer'
//   which preserves casing.

## Indexing multiple fields for FTS

#### The index:

## Boosting search results

* To prioritize results, you can provide a boost value to the searched terms.  
  This can be applied by either of the following:

  * Add a boost value to the relevant index-field **inside the index definition**.  
    Refer to the indexes [Boosting](../../indexes/boosting.mdx) article.  

  * Add a boost value to the queried terms **at query time**.  
    Refer to the [Boost search results](../../client-api/session/querying/text-search/boost-search-results.mdx) article.
