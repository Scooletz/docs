# Document Extensions Overview
<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

* Document extensions are data entities associated with documents.  

* Document extensions are stored separately so that **modifying** an extension value (e.g. a counter 
  or a time series entry) will not modify its parent document.

* **Creating or deleting** an extension changes the parent document's meta-data. 
  This document change may trigger indexing, ETL tasks, and various other operations.  

* In this page:  
   * [The Document Extensions](../document-extensions/overview-extensions.mdx#the-document-extensions)  
   * [Studio Document Extension Views](../document-extensions/overview-extensions.mdx#studio-document-extension-views)

## The Document Extensions

* [Counters](../document-extensions/counters/overview.mdx)  
  RavenDB's distributed counters are numeric data variables that can be added to documents and used
  for various counting tasks.

* [Attachments](../document-extensions/attachments/what-are-attachments.mdx)  
  Attachments are binary streams (videos, images, PDF, etc.) that can be bound to an existing document.

* [Time Series](../document-extensions/timeseries/overview.mdx)  
  Time series are vectors of data that collect values over time, store the values consecutively across the cluster,
  and manage the collected data with high efficiency and performance.

* [Revisions](../document-extensions/revisions/overview.mdx)  
  Document Revisions are snapshots of documents and their extensions that can be created to give access to a document's history.
