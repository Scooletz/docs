# Installation: Manual Setup

By default, when Server is started using `run.ps1` (or `run.sh`) script. It will open a browser with a [Setup Wizard](../../start/installation/setup-wizard.mdx) which will guide you through the Server configuration process.

The setup is started because the default configuration file [settings.json](../../server/configuration/configuration-options.mdx#settingsjson) used in the RavenDB Server package looks like this:

<TabItem value="json" label="json">
<CodeBlock language="json">
{`\{
    "ServerUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:0",
    "Setup.Mode": "Initial",
    "DataDir": "RavenData"
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

Which means that the Server will run:

- In `Setup Wizard` mode
- On `localhost` with a `random port`
- Store the data in `RavenData` directory.

## Disabling 'Setup Wizard'

To disable the 'Setup Wizard' please change the `Setup.Mode` configuration to `None` or remove it completely.

## Server Url and Port

Setting the `ServerUrl` to `http://127.0.0.1:0` will bind the server to a `localhost` with a `random port`. For manual setup we suggest changing the port to a non-random value e.g. **8080**.

<Admonition type="warning" title="Port in Use" id="port-in-use" href="#port-in-use">

In some cases the port might be in use, this will prevent the Server from starting with "address in use" error (`EADDRINUSE`).
