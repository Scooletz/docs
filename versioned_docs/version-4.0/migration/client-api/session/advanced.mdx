# Migration: Changes Related to IAdvancedDocumentSessionOperations

Changes in advanced session operations are accessible by `session.Advanced`.

## GetEtagFor

[Documents don't have etags any longer](../../../migration/client-api/introduction.mdx#etags) but they use change vectors instead the method `GetEtagFor`. It has been replaced by `GetChangeVectorFor`.




## MarkReadOnly

Marking documents as read-only isn't supported. 




## ExplicitlyVersion

The method has been removed. Document revisions configuration doesn't use the `ExcludeUnlessExplicit` option anymore.



## Dealing with Non Authoritative Information

DTC support has been dropped.
