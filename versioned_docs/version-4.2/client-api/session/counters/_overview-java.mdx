* RavenDB's distributed counters, **Counters** for short, are numeric data variables that can be added to documents.  
  Use a Counter to count anything that needs counting, like:
   * Sold products  
   * Voting results  
   * Any event related to the document  
   
* Counters interact with and can trigger other RavenDB features.  
 To find out how to use counters with other features, read [Counters and Other Features](../../../client-api/session/counters/counters-and-other-features.mdx).  

* Create and manage Counters using API methods, or through the [Studio](../../../studio/database/documents/document-view/additional-features/counters.mdx).

## Why use Counters?

#### Convenient Counting Mechanism

Counters are very easy to manage, using simple API methods or through the Studio.  

E.g. Use counters when you want to -  

- Keep track of the number of times a document has been viewed or rated.  
- Count how many visitors from certain countries or regions read a document.  
- Continuously record the number of visitors on an event page.  
- Avoid having to update the whole document for just a numeric value change.  
- Have a need for a high-throughput counter (also see **Distributed Values** below).  
#### Distributed Values

A Counter's value is [distributed between cluster nodes](../../../client-api/session/counters/counters-in-clusters.mdx).  
Among the advantages of this:  

* The cluster **remains available** even when nodes crash.  
* Any node can provide or modify a Counter's value immediately, without checking or coordinating this with other nodes.  
#### High Performance, Low Resources

A document includes the Counter's _name_, while the Counter's actual _value_ is kept in a separate location.  
Modifying a Counter's value doesn't require the modification of the document itself.  
This results in highly efficient operation.
#### High-Frequency Counting

Counters are especially useful when a very large number of counting operations is required,  
because of their speed and low resources usage.  

E.g. Use Counters - 

- For an online election page, to continuously update a Number-Of-Votes Counter for each candidate.  
- To continuously update Counters with the number of visitors in different sections of a big online store.  



## Overview

#### Design

A document's metadata contains only the ***Counters' names-list*** for this document.  
***Counter Values*** are not kept in the document's metadata, but in a separate location.  

Therefore, changes like adding a new counter or deleting an existing counter trigger a document change,  
while simply modifying the Counter Value does not.  
#### Cumulative Counter Actions

- Counter value-modification actions are cumulative, the order in which they are executed doesn't matter.  
  E.g., It doesn't matter if a Counter has been incremented by 2 and then by 7, or by 7 first and then by 2.  
- When a Counter is deleted, the sequence of Counter actions becomes non-cumulative and may require 
  [special attention](../../../client-api/session/counters/counters-in-clusters.mdx#concurrent-delete-and-increment).  
#### Counters and Conflicts

Counter actions (for either name or value) almost never cause conflicts.  
The only exception to this is [concurrent `Delete` and `Increment`](../../../client-api/session/counters/counters-in-clusters.mdx#concurrent-delete-and-increment) 
actions by multiple cluster nodes.  

- Counter actions can be executed concurrently or in any order, without causing a conflict.  
- You can successfully modify Counters while their document is being modified by a different client.  

<Admonition type="note" title="">
Counter actions **can still be performed** when their related documents are in a conflicted state.  
</Admonition>
#### Counters Cost

Counters are designated to lower the cost of counting, but do come with a price.  

* **All the names** of a document's Counters are added to its content, increasing its size.  
* **Counter values** occupy storage space.  

<Admonition type="note" title="">
Be aware that the negligible amount of resources required by a few Counters, 
may become significant when there are many.  
A single document with thousands of Counters is probably an indication of a modeling mistake, 
for example.  
</Admonition>
#### Counters Naming Convention

* Valid characters: All visible characters, [including Unicode symbols](../../../studio/database/documents/document-view/additional-features/counters.mdx#section)  
* Length: Up to 512 bytes  
* Encoding: UTF-8  
#### Counter Values

* Valid range: Signed 64-bit integer (-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807)  
* Only integer additions are supported (no floats or other mathematical operations).
#### Number of Counters Per Document

RavenDB doesn't limit the number of Counters you can create.  

<Admonition type="note" title="">
Note that the Counter names are stored in the document metadata and [do impact the size of the document](../../../client-api/session/counters/overview.mdx#counters-cost).  
</Admonition>
#### The `HasCounters` Flag

When a Counter is added to a document, RavenDB automatically sets a `HasCounters` Flag in the document's metadata.  
When all Counters are removed from a document, the server automatically removes this flag.  



## Managing Counters

#### Counter Methods and the `CountersFor` Object

Managing Counters is performed using the `CountersFor` Session object.  

*  **Counter methods**:  
  - `CountersFor.Increment`: Increment the value of an existing Counter, or create a new Counter if it doesn't exist.  
  - `CountersFor.Delete`: Delete a Counter.  
  - `CountersFor.Get`: Get the current value of a Counter.  
  - `CountersFor.GetAll`: Get _all_ the Counters of a document and their values.  

*  **Usage Flow**:  
  * Open a session.  
  * Create an instance of `CountersFor`.  
      * Either pass `CountersFor` an explicit document ID, -or-  
      * Pass it an [entity tracked by the session](../../../client-api/session/loading-entities.mdx), e.g. a document object returned from [session.query](../../../client-api/session/querying/how-to-query.mdx) or from [session.Load](../../../client-api/session/loading-entities.mdx#load).  
  * Use Counter methods to manage the document's Counters.  
  * If you execute [Increment](../../../client-api/session/counters/create-or-modify.mdx) or [Delete](../../../client-api/session/counters/delete.mdx), call `session.SaveChanges` for the action to take effect on the server.  

*  **Success and Failure**:  
  - As long as the document exists, Counter actions (Increment, Get, Delete etc.) always succeed.
  - When a transaction that includes a Counter modification fails for any reason (e.g. a document concurrency conflict), 
    the Counter modification is reverted.

* **`CountersFor` Usage Samples**  
  You can Use `CountersFor` by **explicitly passing it a document ID** (without pre-loading the document).  
  You can also use `CountersFor` by passing it **the document object**.  
<Tabs groupId='languageSyntax'>
<TabItem value="Pass-CountersFor-Document-ID" label="Pass-CountersFor-Document-ID">
<CodeBlock language="java">
{`// Use CountersFor without loading a document

// 1. Open a session
try (IDocumentSession session = docStore.openSession()) {
    // 2. pass an explicit document ID to the countersFor constructor
    ISessionDocumentCounters documentCounters = session.countersFor("products/1-C");

    // 3. Use \`countersFor\` methods to manage the product document's Counters
    documentCounters.delete("productLikes");  // Delete the "productLikes" Counter
    documentCounters.increment("productModified", 15); // Add 15 to Counter "productModified"
    Long counter = documentCounters.get("daysLeftForSale");// Get "daysLeftForSale"'s value

    // 4. Save changes to the session
    session.saveChanges();
}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Pass-CountersFor-Document-Object" label="Pass-CountersFor-Document-Object">
<CodeBlock language="java">
{`// Use countersFor by passing it a document object

// 1. Open a session
try (IDocumentSession session = docStore.openSession()) {
    // 2. Use the session to load a document.
    Product document = session.load(Product.class, "products/1-C");

    // 3. Create an instance of \`countersFor\`
    //   Pass the document object returned from session.load as a param.
    ISessionDocumentCounters documentCounters = session.countersFor(document);

    // 4. Use \`countersFor\` methods to manage the product document's Counters
    documentCounters.delete("productLikes"); // Delete the "productLikes" Counter
    documentCounters.increment("productModified", 15); // Add 15 to Counter "productModified"
    Long counter = documentCounters.get("daysLeftForSale");// Get value of "daysLeftForSale"

    // 5. Save the changes to the session
    session.saveChanges();
}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
  </Tabs>
#### Managing Counters Using `Operations`

* In addition to working with the high-level Session, you can manage Counters using the low-level [Operations](../../../client-api/operations/what-are-operations.mdx).  

* [CounterBatchOperation](../../../client-api/operations/counters/counter-batch.mdx) 
can operate on a set of Counters of different documents in a single request.
