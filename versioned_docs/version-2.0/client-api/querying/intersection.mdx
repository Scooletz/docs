# Intersection

To allow users to `Intersect` queries on the server-side and return only documents that match **all** the provided sub-queries we have introduced the query intersection feature.

Lets consider a case, where we have a T-Shirt class:

<TabItem value="intersection_1" label="intersection_1">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`public class TShirt
\{
	public string Id \{ get; set; \}

	public int ReleaseYear \{ get; set; \}

	public string Manufacturer \{ get; set; \}

	public List<TShirtType> Types \{ get; set; \}
\}

public class TShirtType
\{
	public string Color \{ get; set; \}

	public string Size \{ get; set; \}
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

Index:

<TabItem value="intersection_2" label="intersection_2">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`public class TShirts_ByManufacturerColorSizeAndReleaseYear : AbstractIndexCreationTask<TShirt>
\{
	public class Result
	\{
		public string Manufacturer \{ get; set; \}

		public string Color \{ get; set; \}

		public string Size \{ get; set; \}

		public int ReleaseYear \{ get; set; \}
	\}

	public TShirts_ByManufacturerColorSizeAndReleaseYear()
	\{
		Map = tshirts => from tshirt in tshirts
						 from type in tshirt.Types
						 select new
							 \{
								 Manufacturer = tshirt.Manufacturer,
								 Color = type.Color,
								 Size = type.Size,
								 ReleaseYear = tshirt.ReleaseYear
							 \};
	\}
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

Few records:

<TabItem value="intersection_3" label="intersection_3">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`session.Store(new TShirt
	\{
		Id = "tshirts/1",
		Manufacturer = "Raven",
		ReleaseYear = 2010,
		Types = new List<TShirtType>
			\{
				new TShirtType \{Color = "Blue", Size = "Small"\},
				new TShirtType \{Color = "Black", Size = "Small"\},
				new TShirtType \{Color = "Black", Size = "Medium"\},
				new TShirtType \{Color = "Gray", Size = "Large"\}
			\}
	\});

session.Store(new TShirt
\{
	Id = "tshirts/2",
	Manufacturer = "Wolf",
	ReleaseYear = 2011,
	Types = new List<TShirtType>
			\{
				new TShirtType \{ Color = "Blue",  Size = "Small" \},                                    
				new TShirtType \{ Color = "Black", Size = "Large" \},
				new TShirtType \{ Color = "Gray",  Size = "Medium" \}
			\}
\});

session.Store(new TShirt
\{
	Id = "tshirts/3",
	Manufacturer = "Raven",
	ReleaseYear = 2011,
	Types = new List<TShirtType>
			\{
				new TShirtType \{ Color = "Yellow",  Size = "Small" \},
				new TShirtType \{ Color = "Gray",  Size = "Large" \}
			\}
\});

session.Store(new TShirt
\{
	Id = "tshirts/4",
	Manufacturer = "Raven",
	ReleaseYear = 2012,
	Types = new List<TShirtType>
			\{
				new TShirtType \{ Color = "Blue",  Size = "Small" \},
				new TShirtType \{ Color = "Gray",  Size = "Large" \}
			\}
\});
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

Now we want to return all the T-shirts that are manufactured by `Raven` and contain both `Small` `Blue` and `Large` `Gray` types. To do this, we just need to use `Intersect` query extension from `Raven.Client` namespace

<TabItem value="intersection_4" label="intersection_4">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`session
	.Query<TShirts_ByManufacturerColorSizeAndReleaseYear.Result, TShirts_ByManufacturerColorSizeAndReleaseYear>()
	.Where(x => x.Manufacturer == "Raven")
	.Intersect()
	.Where(x => x.Color == "Blue" && x.Size == "Small")
	.Intersect()
	.Where(x => x.Color == "Gray" && x.Size == "Large")
	.OfType<TShirt>()
	.ToList();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

or its equivalent in Lucene syntax

<TabItem value="intersection_5" label="intersection_5">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`session
	.Advanced
	.LuceneQuery<TShirt, TShirts_ByManufacturerColorSizeAndReleaseYear>()
	.WhereEquals("Manufacturer", "Raven")
	.Intersect()
	.WhereEquals("Color", "Blue")
	.AndAlso()
	.WhereEquals("Size", "Small")
	.Intersect()
	.WhereEquals("Color", "Gray")
	.AndAlso()
	.WhereEquals("Size", "Large")
	.ToList();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

Above query will return `tshirts/1` and `tshirts/4` as a result. Document `tshirts/2` will not be included, because it is not manufactured by `Raven` and `tshirts/3` is not available in `Small` `Blue` so it does not match **all** the sub-queries.
