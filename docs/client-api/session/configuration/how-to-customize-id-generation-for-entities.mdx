<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

RavenDB provides several ways to create document IDs.  

- To get familiar with basic built-in ID generation strategies 
  before starting to customize entity identifiers, please see:  
  [Working with Document Identifiers](../../../client-api/document-identifiers/working-with-document-identifiers)  

- To learn about conventions related to ID customization, please see 
  the following articles, presenting conventions that can be applied 
  to all entity types or to a particular type.  
   - [Global ID Generation Conventions](../../../client-api/configuration/identifier-generation/global)  
   - [Type-specific ID Generation Conventions](../../../client-api/configuration/identifier-generation/type-specific)
