* To modify existing documents:

    * **Retrieve** documents from the database using [load](../../client-api/session/loading-entities.mdx#load) or by a [query](../../client-api/session/querying/how-to-query.mdx#sessionquery).  
      The entities loaded from the documents are added to the internal entities map that the Session manages.
  
    * **Edit** the properties you wish to change.  
      The session will track all changes made to the loaded entities.

    * **Save** to apply the changes.  
      Once `save_changes()` returns it is guaranteed that the data is persisted in the database.

## Load a document & update

* In this example we `load` a company document and update its **PostalCode** property.  

<TabItem value="load-company-and-update" label="load-company-and-update">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`with store.open_session() as session:
    # Load a company document
    # The entity loaded from the document will be added to the Session's entities map
    company = session.load("companies/1-A", Company)

    # Update the company's postal_code
    company.address["postal_code"] = "TheNewPostalCode"

    # In Python client nested objects are loaded as dicts for convenience
    # You can customize and control your class (from/to) JSON conversion to fit any case
    # Implement classmethod 'from_json(json_dict) -> YourType' to control how the object its being read
    # Implement method 'to_json() -> Dict' to manage how it's serialized

    # Apply changes
    session.save_changes()
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## Query for documents & update

* In this example we `query` for company documents whose **PostalCode** property is _12345_,  
  and modify this property for the matching documents.  

<TabItem value="query-companies-and-update" label="query-companies-and-update">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`with store.open_session() as session:
    # Query: find companies with the specified postal_code
    # The entities loaded from the matching documents will be added to the Session's entities map
    query = session.query(object_type=Company).where_equals("address.postal_code", "12345")

    matching_companies = list(query)

    # Update the postal_code for the resulting company documents
    for company in matching_companies:
        company.address["postal_code"] = "TheNewPostalCode"

    # Apply changes
    session.save_changes()
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
