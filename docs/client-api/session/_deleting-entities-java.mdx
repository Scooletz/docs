Entities can be marked for deletion by using the `delete` method, but will not be removed from the server until `saveChanges` is called.

## Syntax

<TabItem value="deleting_1" label="deleting_1">
<CodeBlock language="java">
{`<T> void delete(T entity);

void delete(String id);

void delete(String id, String expectedChangeVector);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

| Parameters | | |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| **entity** | `T` | instance of the entity to delete |
| **id** | `String` | ID of the entity to delete |
| **expectedChangeVector** | `String` | a change vector to use for concurrency checks |

## Example I

<TabItem value="deleting_2" label="deleting_2">
<CodeBlock language="java">
{`Employee employee = session.load(Employee.class, "employees/1");

session.delete(employee);
session.saveChanges();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

<Admonition type="note" title="Concurrency on Delete" id="concurrency-on-delete" href="#concurrency-on-delete">
If useOptimisticConcurrency is set to 'true' (default 'false'), the delete() method will use loaded 'employees/1' change vector for concurrency check and might throw ConcurrencyException.
</Admonition>

## Example II

<TabItem value="deleting_3" label="deleting_3">
<CodeBlock language="java">
{`session.delete("employees/1");
session.saveChanges();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

<Admonition type="note" title="Concurrency on Delete" id="concurrency-on-delete" href="#concurrency-on-delete">
In this overload, the delete() method will not do any change vector based concurrency checks because the change vector for 'employees/1' is unknown.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info" title="Information" id="information" href="#information">

If entity is **not** tracked by session, then executing

<TabItem value="deleting_4" label="deleting_4">
<CodeBlock language="java">
{`session.delete("employees/1");
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

is equal to doing

<TabItem value="deleting_5" label="deleting_5">
<CodeBlock language="java">
{`session.advanced().defer(new DeleteCommandData("employees/1", null));
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

<Admonition type="note" title="Change Vector in DeleteCommandData" id="change-vector-in-deletecommanddata" href="#change-vector-in-deletecommanddata">
In this sample the change vector is null - this means that there will be no concurrency checks. A non-null and valid change vector value will trigger a concurrency check.
