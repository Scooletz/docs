# FAQ: Backward Compatibility
<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

* RavenDB is released in **Major** versions like 4.0 and 5.0, which are 
  complemented over time by **Minor** versions like 5.1 and 5.2.  

* This article explains which major and minor RavenDB Clients and Servers are 
  compatible, and advises regarding upgrading.

## Client/Server Compatibility

### Compatibility - Up to RavenDB 4.1
RavenDB **Clients** of versions lower than 4.2 are compatible with **Servers 
of the same Major version** (3.x Clients with 3.x Servers, 4.x Clients 
with 4.x Servers), and a **Minor version the same as theirs or higher**.  
E.g. -  

* `Client 3.0` is **compatible** with `Server 3.0`, because they are of the exact 
  same version.  
* `Client 4.0` is **compatible** with `Server 4.1` because they are of the same 
  major version and the server is of a higher minor version.  
* `Client 4.1.7` is **compatible** with `Server 4.1.6` because 
  though the client is a little newer, the server is of the same 
  minor version (1) as the client.  
* `Client 3.0` is **not** compatible with `Server 4.0` because the 
  server is of a different major version.  
* `Client 4.5` is **not** compatible with `Server 4.0` because the 
  server is of a lower minor version.  

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

* A server that receives an erroneous client request, will check 
  whether the client version is supported.  
* If the client version is not supported, an exception will be thrown:  
  **`RavenDB does not support interaction between Client API major version 3 and Server version 4
  when major version does not match.`**  

</Admonition>
### Compatibility - RavenDB 4.2 and Higher
Starting with version 4.2, RavenDB clients are compatible with 
any server of their own version **and higher**.  
E.g. -  

* `Client 4.2` is **compatible** with `Server 4.2`, `Server 4.5`, 
  `Server 5.2`, and any other server of a higher version.  



## Upgrading

### Upgrading - Up to RavenDB 4.1
Upgrading RavenDB from a version earlier than 4.2 to a higher major version, 
requires the upgrading of the server and all clients in lockstep.  
Please visit our [migration introduction](../../migration/client-api/introduction) 
page to learn more about migrating from early versions.  
### Upgrading - RavenDB 4.2 and Higher
When RavenDB is upgraded from version 4.2 and higher, e.g. from 4.2 to 5.3, 
it is recommended - but not mandatory - to upgrade the clients, since they 
are [compatible with servers of versions higher than theirs](../../client-api/faq/backward-compatibility#ravendb-4.2-and-higher-compatibility).  
### Upgrading Order
To properly upgrade your applications and server, we advise you to upgrade the server first, 
then the clients.  
This way, your applications will keep working as before and you can update 
them one by one if needed.
