# What Is the Changes API
<LanguageSwitcher supportedLanguages={supportedLanguages} />
<LanguageContent language="csharp">

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

* The Changes API is a Push Notifications service, that allows a RavenDB Client to 
  receive messages from a RavenDB Server regarding events that occurred on the server.  
* A client can subscribe to events related to documents, indexes, operations, counters, and time series.  
* Using the Changes API allows you to notify users of various changes without requiring 
  any expensive polling.

</Admonition>
## Accessing Changes API

The changes subscription is accessible by a document store through its `IDatabaseChanges` 
or `ISingleNodeDatabaseChanges` interfaces.

<TabItem value="something" label="changes_1">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`IDatabaseChanges Changes(string database = null);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="something" label="changes_ISingleNodeDatabaseChanges">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`ISingleNodeDatabaseChanges Changes(string database, string nodeTag);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

| Parameters | | |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| **database** | `string` | Name of database to open changes API for. If `null`, the `Database` configured in DocumentStore will be used. |
| **nodeTag** | `string` | Tag of the cluster node to open changes API for. |

| Return value | |
| ------------- | ----- |
| `IDatabaseChanges` | Instance implementing `IDatabaseChanges` interface. |
| `ISingleNodeDatabaseChanges` | Instance implementing `ISingleNodeDatabaseChanges` interface. |

* Use `IDatabaseChanges` to subscribe to database changes.  
* Use `ISingleNodeDatabaseChanges` to limit tracking to a specific node.  
  <Admonition type="note" title="Note">
  Note that from RavenDB 6.2 on, some changes can be tracked not cross-cluster but only 
  **on a specific node**. In these cases, it is required that you open the Changes API using 
  the second overload, passing both a database name and a node tag: `store.Changes(dbName, nodeTag)`  
  </Admonition>



## Connection interface

`IDatabaseChanges` inherits from `IConnectableChanges<TChanges>` interface that represent the connection.

<TabItem value="something" label="connectable_changes">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`public interface IConnectableChanges<TChanges> : IDisposable
    where TChanges : IDatabaseChanges
\{
    // returns state of the connection
    bool Connected \{ get; \}

    // A task that ensures that the connection to the server was established.
    Task<TChanges> EnsureConnectedNow();

    //An event handler to detect changed to the connection status
    event EventHandler ConnectionStatusChanged;

    //An action to take if an error occured in the connection to the server
    event Action<Exception> OnError;
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## Subscribing

To receive notifications regarding server-side events, subscribe using one of the following methods.  

* **For Document Changes:**  
   - [ForAllDocuments](../../client-api/changes/how-to-subscribe-to-document-changes#foralldocuments)  
     Track changes for all document  
   - [ForDocument](../../client-api/changes/how-to-subscribe-to-document-changes#fordocument)  
     Track changes for a given document (by Doc ID)  
   - [ForDocumentsInCollection](../../client-api/changes/how-to-subscribe-to-document-changes#fordocumentsincollection)  
     Track changes for all documents in a given collection  
   - [ForDocumentsStartingWith](../../client-api/changes/how-to-subscribe-to-document-changes#fordocumentsstartingwith)  
     Track changes for documents whose ID contains a given prefix  

* **For Index Changes:**  
   - [ForAllIndexes](../../client-api/changes/how-to-subscribe-to-index-changes#forallindexes)  
     Track changes for all indexes  
   - [ForIndex](../../client-api/changes/how-to-subscribe-to-index-changes#forindex)  
     Track changes for a given index (by Index Name)   

* **For Operation Changes:**  
  Operation changes can be tracked only [on a specific node](../../client-api/changes/what-is-changes-api#accessing-changes-api).  
   - [ForAllOperations](../../client-api/changes/how-to-subscribe-to-operation-changes#foralloperations)  
     Track changes for all operation  
   - [ForOperationId](../../client-api/changes/how-to-subscribe-to-operation-changes#foroperationid)  
     Track changes for a given operation (by Operation ID)  

* **For Counter Changes:**  
   - [ForAllCounters](../../client-api/changes/how-to-subscribe-to-counter-changes#forallcounters)  
     Track changes for all counters  
   - [ForCounter](../../client-api/changes/how-to-subscribe-to-counter-changes#forcounter)  
     Track changes for a given counter (by Counter Name)  
   - [ForCounterOfDocument](../../client-api/changes/how-to-subscribe-to-counter-changes#forcounterofdocument)  
     Track changes for a specific counter of a chosen document (by Doc ID and Counter Name)  
   - [ForCountersOfDocument](../../client-api/changes/how-to-subscribe-to-counter-changes#forcountersofdocument)  
     Track changes for all counters of a chosen document (by Doc ID)

   - [ForAllTimeSeries](../../client-api/changes/how-to-subscribe-to-time-series-changes#foralltimeseries)  
     Track changes for all time series  
   - [ForTimeSeries](../../client-api/changes/how-to-subscribe-to-time-series-changes#fortimeseries)  
     Track changes for all time series with a given name  
   - [ForTimeSeriesOfDocument](../../client-api/changes/how-to-subscribe-to-time-series-changes#fortimeseriesofdocument)  
     Track changes for -  
      * a **specific time series** of a given document (by Doc ID and Time Series Name)  
      * **any time series** of a given document (by Doc ID)  



## Unsubscribing

To end a subscription (stop listening for particular notifications) you must 
`Dispose` of the subscription.  

<TabItem value="something" label="changes_2">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`IDatabaseChanges changes = store.Changes();
await changes.EnsureConnectedNow();
var subscription = changes
        .ForAllDocuments()
        .Subscribe(change => Console.WriteLine("\{0\} on document \{1\}", change.Type, change.Id));
try
\{
    // application code here
\}
finally
\{
    if (subscription != null)
        subscription.Dispose();
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## FAQ

#### Changes API and Database Timeout

One or more open Changes API connections will prevent a database from becoming 
idle and unloaded, regardless of [the configuration value for database idle timeout](../../server/configuration/database-configuration#databases.maxidletimeinsec).  
#### Changes API and Method Overloads

<Admonition type="warning" title="Warning">
To get more method overloads, especially ones supporting **delegates**, please add the

## Changes API -vs- Data Subscriptions

**Changes API** and [Data Subscription](../../client-api/data-subscriptions/what-are-data-subscriptions) 
are services that a RavenDB Server provides subscribing clients.  
Both services respond to events that take place on the server, by sending updates 
to their subscribers.  

* **Changes API is a Push Notifications Service**.  
   * Changes API subscribers receive **notifications** regarding events that 
     took place on the server, without receiving the actual data entities 
     affected by these events.  
     For the modification of a document, for example, the client will receive 
     a [DocumentChange](../../client-api/changes/how-to-subscribe-to-document-changes#documentchange) 
     object with details like the document's ID and collection name.  

   * The server does **not** keep track of sent notifications or 
     checks clients' usage of them. It is a client's responsibility 
     to manage its reactions to such notifications.  

* **Data Subscription is a Data Consumption Service**.  
   * A Data Subscription task keeps track of document modifications in the 
     database and delivers the documents in an orderly fashion when subscribers 
     indicate they are ready to receive them. 
   * The process is fully managed by the server, leaving very little for 
     the subscribers to do besides consuming the delivered documents.
