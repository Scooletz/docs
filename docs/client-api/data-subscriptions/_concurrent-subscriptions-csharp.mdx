* With **Concurrent Subscriptions**, multiple data subscription workers can connect to the same subscription task simultaneously.

* Each worker is assigned a different batch of documents to process.

* By processing different batches in parallel, multiple workers can significantly accelerate the consumption of the subscription's contents.

* Documents that were assigned to workers whose connection has ended unexpectedly,  
  can be reassigned by the server to available workers. 
  See [connection failure](../../client-api/data-subscriptions/concurrent-subscriptions.mdx#connection-failure) below.

## Defining concurrent workers

Concurrent workers are defined similarly to other workers, except their 
[strategy](../../client-api/data-subscriptions/consumption/how-to-consume-data-subscription.mdx#worker-strategies) 
is set to [SubscriptionOpeningStrategy.Concurrent](../../client-api/data-subscriptions/consumption/how-to-consume-data-subscription.mdx#multiple-workers-per-subscription-strategy).  

* To define a concurrent worker:  
   * Create the worker using [GetSubscriptionWorker](../../client-api/data-subscriptions/consumption/api-overview.mdx#create-the-subscription-worker).  
   * Pass it a [SubscriptionWorkerOptions](../../client-api/data-subscriptions/consumption/api-overview.mdx#subscriptionworkeroptions) instance.  
   * Set the strategy to `SubscriptionOpeningStrategy.Concurrent`  

* Usage:  
   * Define two concurrent workers  
<TabItem value="conSub_defineWorkers" label="conSub_defineWorkers">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`// Define concurrent subscription workers
var subscriptionWorker1 = store.Subscriptions.GetSubscriptionWorker<Order>(
    // Set the worker to connect to the "All Orders" subscription task
    new SubscriptionWorkerOptions("All Orders")
    \{
        // Set Concurrent strategy
        Strategy = SubscriptionOpeningStrategy.Concurrent,
        MaxDocsPerBatch = 20
    \});

var subscriptionWorker2 = store.Subscriptions.GetSubscriptionWorker<Order>(
    new SubscriptionWorkerOptions("All Orders")
    \{
        Strategy = SubscriptionOpeningStrategy.Concurrent,
        MaxDocsPerBatch = 20
    \});
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
   * Run both workers  
<TabItem value="conSub_runWorkers" label="conSub_runWorkers">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`// Start the concurrent worker. Workers will connect concurrently to the "All Orders" subscription task.
var subscriptionRuntimeTask1 = subscriptionWorker1.Run(batch =>
\{
    // process batch
    foreach (var item in batch.Items)
    \{
        // process item
    \}
\});

var subscriptionRuntimeTask2 = subscriptionWorker2.Run(batch =>
\{
    // process batch
    foreach (var item in batch.Items)
    \{
        // process item
    \}
\});
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## Dropping a connection

* Use `Subscriptions.DropSubscriptionWorker` to **forcefully disconnect** 
  the specified worker from the subscription it is connected to.  
<TabItem value="csharp" label="csharp">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`public void DropSubscriptionWorker<T>(SubscriptionWorker<T> worker, string database = null)
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

* Usage:  
<TabItem value="conSub_dropWorker" label="conSub_dropWorker">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`//drop a concurrent subscription worker
store.Subscriptions.DropSubscriptionWorker(subscriptionWorker2);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## Connection failure

* When a concurrent worker's connection ends unexpectedly, 
  the server may reassign the documents this worker has been processing to any other concurrent worker that is available.  
* A worker that reconnects after a connection failure will be assigned a **new** batch of documents.  
  It is **not** guaranteed that the new batch will contain the same documents this worker was processing before the disconnection.
* As a result, documents may be processed more than once:  
  - first by a worker that disconnected unexpectedly without acknowledging the completion of its assigned documents, 
  - and later by other workers the documents are reassigned to.
