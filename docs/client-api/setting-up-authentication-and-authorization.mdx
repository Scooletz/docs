# Client API: Setting up Authentication and Authorization
<LanguageSwitcher supportedLanguages={supportedLanguages} />
<LanguageContent language="csharp">

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

* **Authentication and authorization** are based on [Client X.509 Certificates](../server/security/authorization/security-clearance-and-permissions).  

* When your RavenDB instance runs on HTTPS, the server has a **Server Certificate** loaded.  
Your application must use a **Client Certificate** in order to access this secure server.  

* Obtain a Client Certificate from your cluster admin.  
The Client Certificate is generated by the admin from the [Studio](../server/security/authentication/certificate-management).  

* The security clearance (authorization level) for the generated Client Certificate is set during the process of generating the 
certificate.  

* Pass your Client Certificate to the Document Store before initialization, as shown in the example code 
[below](../client-api/setting-up-authentication-and-authorization#example---initializing-document-store-with-a-client-certificate).  
The server will use this certificate to authenticate the client when connection is established.

## Example - Initializing Document Store With a Client Certificate

<TabItem value="something" label="client_cert">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`// Load a X.509 certificate
X509Certificate2 clientCertificate = new X509Certificate2("C:\\\\path_to_your_pfx_file\\\\cert.pfx");

using (IDocumentStore store = new DocumentStore()
\{
    // Pass your certificate to the \`Certificate\` property
    Certificate = clientCertificate,
    Database = "your_database_name",
    Urls = new[] \{"https://your_RavenDB_server_URL"\}
\}.Initialize())
\{
    // Do your work here
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>




</LanguageContent>
<LanguageContent language="java">


Authentication and authorization is based on [client X.509 certificates](../server/security/authorization/security-clearance-and-permissions).

The `certificate` property allows you to pass a certificate which will be used by the RavenDB client to connect to a server. 

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">
If your RavenDB instance is running on 'https', then your application has to use a client certificate in order to be able to access the server. You can find more information [here](../server/security/overview).
</Admonition>

## Example

<TabItem value="something-something" label="client_cert">
<CodeBlock language="java">
{`// load certificate
// pem file should contain both public and private key
KeyStore clientStore = CertificateUtils.createKeystore("c:\\\\ravendb\\\\app.client.certificate.pem");

try (DocumentStore store = new DocumentStore())  \{
    store.setCertificate(clientStore);
    store.setDatabase("Northwind");
    store.setUrls(new String[]\{ "https://my_secured_raven" \});

    store.initialize();

    // do your work here
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>


</LanguageContent>
<LanguageContent language="nodejs">


Authentication and authorization is based on [client X.509 certificates](../server/security/authorization/security-clearance-and-permissions).

The authentication options argument in `DocumentStore` constructor property allows you to pass a certificate which will be used by the RavenDB client to connect to a server. 

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">
If your RavenDB server instance is served using `https`, then your application is required to use a client certificate in order to be able to access the server. You can find more information [here](../server/security/overview).
</Admonition>

## Example

<TabItem value="something-something" label="client_cert">
<CodeBlock language="nodejs">
{`import \{ DocumentStore \} from "ravendb";
import * as fs from "fs";

// load certificate and prepare authentication options
const authOptions = \{
    certificate: fs.readFileSync("C:\\\\ravendb\\\\client-cert.pfx"),
    type: "pfx", // or "pem"
    password: "my passphrase"
\};

const store = new DocumentStore([ "https://my_secured_raven" ], "Northwind", authOptions);
store.initialize();

// proceed with your work here
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
