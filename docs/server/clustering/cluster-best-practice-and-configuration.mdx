### Clusters should have an odd number of at least 3 nodes

We recommend setting up clusters with an odd number of nodes equal to or greater than 3.

**A single node cluster:**  
Will not have the ability to automatically failover to another node if it goes down.  
This means that it is not highly available.  

**A two nodes cluster:**  
Also not recommended since the cluster must have a consensus among the majority of nodes to operate.  
With a two-node cluster, if one of the nodes is down or partitioned, the other node is not considered a 'majority'
and thus no [Raft](../../glossary/raft-algorithm) 
command will be created, although any database on the surviving node will still be responsive to the user.  

**Odd number of 3 or more nodes:**  
For ACID guarantees, a majority of the nodes must agree on every [cluster-wide transaction](../../server/clustering/cluster-transactions), 
so having an odd number of nodes makes achieving the majority easier.





### Avoid different cluster configurations among the cluster's nodes

Configuration mismatches tend to cause interaction problems between nodes.

If you must set [cluster configurations](../../server/configuration/cluster-configuration) differently in separate nodes,  
**we recommend first testing it** in a development environment to see that each node interacts properly with the others.
