# Embedded Server: TestDriver Breaking Changes
<Admonition type="note" title="Note">
The features listed on this page were available in former RavenDB versions.  
In RavenDB `6.2.x`, they are either unavailable or their behavior is inconsistent 
with their behavior in previous versions.

## Unlicensed TestDriver throws an exception

### Background:

The [RavenDB.TestDriver](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RavenDB.TestDriver/) package 
allows users to create [unit tests](../../start/test-driver.mdx) for their applications, 
and run the tests using an [embedded server](../../server/embedded.mdx) included in the package.  

Like other types of RavenDB server, the features that an embedded server supports 
and the resources it can use are defined by its [license](https://ravendb.net/buy).  
An unlicensed server, for example, can use only 3 CPU cores, while a server 
licensed using a [free developers license](https://ravendb.net/buy#developer) 
can use up to 9 cores and run way faster.  

* When a RavenDB server starts, its license is validated.  
   * If the validation succeeds, the server will run and offer the capabilities defined 
     by its license.  
   * If the validation fails, the server may still run but limit its capabilities to those 
     defined by the basic [AGPL](https://ravendb.net/legal/ravendb/commercial-license-eula) 
     license.  
     <Admonition type="note" title="Note">
     If the validation fails because the license expired, and the expiration date precedes 
     the server build date, the server will not start at all.  
     </Admonition>

* A `TestServerOptions.Licensing.ThrowOnInvalidOrMissingLicense` configuration option 
  is available since RavenDB `5.4`, determining whether to throw a `LicenseExpiredException` 
  exception if TestDriver uses an unlicensed embedded server.  
   * If `ThrowOnInvalidOrMissingLicense` is set to **`true`** and the validation fails, 
     a `LicenseExpiredException` exception will be thrown to **warn TestDriver users** 
     that in lack of a valid license, their server's capabilities are limited and they 
     may therefore miss out on much of their system's potential.  
   * If the configuration option is set to **`false`**, **no exception will be thrown** 
     even if a license cannot be validated.  
### The breaking change:

Up until RavenDB version `6.0`, we set `TestServerOptions.Licensing.ThrowOnInvalidOrMissingLicense` 
to **`false`** by default, so no exception would be thrown even if license validation fails.  
For an exception to be thrown, users needed to change the flag to **`true`** on their own initiative.  

In version `6.2`, the default value for this configuration option **changed** to **`true`**;  
a `LicenseExpiredException` exception **would** be thrown if the embedded server used by 
TestDriver fails to validate a license.  

Users that prefer that no exception would be thrown if an unlicensed embedded server is 
used, can set `TestServerOptions.Licensing.ThrowOnInvalidOrMissingLicense` to **`false`**.
