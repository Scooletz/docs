# Working with RavenDB's Dockerfile

RavenDBâ€™s image and Dockerfile provide a universal and flexible base.
If you need to, you can either extend the existing `ravendb/ravendb` image with your modifications or build a new image entirely by tweaking its Dockerfile.
Additionally, for complex scenarios, you can replace the default entry script (`run-raven.sh`) in both cases to fully customize the startup process.


- To learn about Dockerfile, visit this page:  [Containers &gt; Dockerfile &gt; Overview](./dockerfile-overview)


- If you want to modify the image, or use it as a base, go here: [Containers &gt; Dockerfile &gt; Extending & Tuning](./extending)


- To go deep with running RavenDB on prod in containers, visit our requirements knowledge base:  [Containers &gt; Requirements](../requirements/compute), or read some of our [articles](https://ravendb.net/articles) - look for deployment guides.


- If you have encountered a unique significant problem, contact our [support](https://ravendb.net/support) for help.
