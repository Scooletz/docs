* When retrieving documents that contain time series, you can request to _include_ their time series data.

* The included time series data is held by the client's session, so it can be handed to the user instantly when requested without issuing an additional request to the server.

* Time series data can be _included_ when -
    * [Loading a document using `session.Load`](../../../../../document-extensions/timeseries/client-api/session/include/with-session-load)
    * [Loading a document by query via `session.Query`](../../../../../document-extensions/timeseries/client-api/session/include/with-session-query)
    * [Loading a document by raw query via `session.Advanced.RawQuery`](../../../../../document-extensions/timeseries/client-api/session/include/with-raw-queries)
