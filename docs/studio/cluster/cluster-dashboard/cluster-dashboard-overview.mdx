## Cluster Dashboard Initial Display

As long as a cluster hasn't been set yet, the cluster dashboard displays 
an expanded view of the [Let's Get Started](../../../studio/cluster/cluster-dashboard/cluster-dashboard-widgets#lets-get-started-widget) widget.

   Open the cluster dashboard view from the main menu.  
2. **Let's Get Started Widget**  



## Cluster Dashboard Widgets Display

Once a cluster has been set, the dashboard displays [widgets](../../../studio/cluster/cluster-dashboard/cluster-dashboard-widgets) 
with live cluster diagnostics, information, and configuration options.

2. **Diagnostics**  
   Widgets display information related to **all cluster nodes**.  



## Setup changes

The dashboard displays information for all cluster nodes.  

After making a change to the cluster setup, i.e. adding or removing a node,
please **refresh** the cluster dashboard page to view the relevant cluster nodes.  

Here, for example, is the Memory widget after removing node C from the cluster.
