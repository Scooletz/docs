# Identities View
<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

* This view lists the __latest identities values__ that are set on the server for all collections where  
  an identity was created.

* You can edit existing values or set a new identity value for a collection.

* Identities values can also be managed from the Client API, see [seed identity operation](../../../client-api/operations/maintenance/identities/seed-identity).

* In this page:  
  * [What is an identity](../../../studio/database/documents/identities-view#what-is-an-identity)  
  * [The latest values](../../../studio/database/documents/identities-view#the-latest-values)  
  * [Edit identity value](../../../studio/database/documents/identities-view#edit-identity-value)  
  * [Add new identity](../../../studio/database/documents/identities-view#add-new-identity)  
</Admonition>
## What is an identity

* An identity is a document ID generated by the server upon document creation time  
  (when adding a pipe `|` as a suffix to the requested document ID).

* The identity ID is __unique__ in the database, across all nodes within the Database Group.

* The identity document ID is composed of:  
  * The collection name  
  * And a number that is continuously incremented per document creation ("the latest value")  
    e.g. `employees/5`

* Learn more about identities in:
  * [Document identifier generation](../../../server/kb/document-identifier-generation#strategy--3)
  * [Working with document identifiers](../../../client-api/document-identifiers/working-with-document-identifiers#identities)



## The latest values

![Figure 1. Latest identities values](./assets/identities-view-1.png)

1. Navigate to __Documents &gt; Identities__

2. __Document ID Prefix__  

   * This string is the collection name for which an identity value was set:  
     either [via this view](../../../studio/database/documents/identities-view#add-new-identity), 
     or by creating a document with an identity ID as described [here](../../../client-api/document-identifiers/working-with-document-identifiers#identities).  
   
   * The string that shows is the collection name + a pipe suffix.  

3. __Latest Value__  

   * This is the latest identity value currently set on the server for the collection.
   
   * <Admonition type="info" title="Info">
      In this example - the latest value for the _employees_ collection is `3`.  
      This means the next document that will be created with an identity in the _employees_ collection  
      will get the ID `employees/4`.
     </Admonition> 

4. Click to edit the latest value.

5. Click to add a new identity value for another collection.



## Edit identity value

![Figure 2. Edit identity value](./assets/identities-view-2.png)

1. __Prefix__  
   The collection for which the value is edited.

2. __Value__  

   * Enter a number that will be set as the latest identity value for this collection.

   * In this example we set the value to `25`.  
     This means the next document that will be created with an identity in the _employees_ collection  
     will get the ID `employees/26`.

3. Click 'Update' to set the new value.



## Add new identity

![Figure 3. Add new identity](./assets/identities-view-3.png)

1. __Prefix__  

   * Enter the collection name for which to set an identity value.  
     (Using the pipe suffix here is optional, e.g. can enter "users" or "users|").
   
   * Note: you can specify a collection name that has not been created yet.  

2. __Value__

    * Enter a number that will be set as the latest identity value for this collection.

    * In this example we set the value to `99`.  
      This means the next document that will be created with an identity in the _users_ collection  
      will get the ID `users/100`.

3. Click 'Create' to create the new identity.
