# Documents: Compare Exchange View
<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

* [Compare-Exchange](../../../client-api/operations/compare-exchange/overview) are cluster-wide key/value pair items where the key 
  is a unique identifier in the database.

* CmpXchg items coordinate work between sessions that are 
  trying to modify a shared resource (such as a document) at the same time.

* Compare exchange items are created and managed by either of the following:
  * RavenDB [Atomic Guards](../../../client-api/session/cluster-transaction/atomic-guards)  
    To guarantee ACIDity across the cluster, 
    as of RavenDB 5.2, we automatically create and maintain Atomic Guard CmpXchg items in cluster-wide sessions.  
  * [API Operations](../../../client-api/operations/compare-exchange/overview)
  * [Session - Cluster Transaction](../../../client-api/session/cluster-transaction/overview)
  * Using the [RavenDB Studio](../../../studio/database/documents/compare-exchange-view#the-compare-exchange-view)

* In this page:

## The Compare Exchange View

![Compare Exchange View](./assets/compare-exchange-view.png)

1. **Documents Tab**  
   Select to see document-related options and the list of documents in this database .  
2. **Compare Exchange**  
   Select to see the Compare Exchange view.  
3. **Add new item**  
   Click to add a new compare exchange key/value pair.  
4. **Compare exchange key/value properties**  
   Click the edit button or key name to edit this item.  
    ![Compare Exchange Single Pair](./assets/compare-exchange-single-pair.png)
    1. **Key**  
       A unique identifier that is reserved across the cluster.  
       Enter any string of your choice.  
        <Admonition type="info" title="Atomic Guards" id="atomic-guards" href="#atomic-guards">
        If keys start with "rvn-atomic", they are [Atomic Guards](../../../client-api/session/cluster-transaction/atomic-guards).  
        They are created and maintained automatically to guarantee ACID cluster-wide transactions.  
        **Do not remove or edit these** as this will disable ACID guarantees.

        </Admonition>
    2. **Value**  
       Enter a value that will be associated with the key.  
       Values can be numbers, strings, arrays, or objects. Any value that can be represented as JSON is valid.
    3. **Metadata**  
       Click to add metadata.  
       The metadata is associated with the key, similar to document's metadata.  
    4. **Raft Index**  
       The raft index increments automatically each time the value or metadata are changed, indicating the compare-exchange item's 
       current version.  
    5. **Delete**  
       Click to delete this compare exchange item.  
       <Admonition type="warning" title="Warning" id="warning" href="#warning">
       Deleting a compare exchange item will remove ACID guarantees for transactions if the pair was set up to protect ACIDity.  
       Only remove or edit these if you _truly_ know what you're doing.  
       </Admonition>
    6. **Save**  
       Save will only succeed if the Raft Index version that is currently stored within RavenDB for this key 
       matches the version that shows in the view.
