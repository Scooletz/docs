## Database Stats

![Figure 1. Database Stats](./assets/database-stats.png)

1. **Database state**    
   A database can be: _Online_ , _Offline_ or _Disabled_        

   * ***Online***   - the database is active and ready to use. Read and write actions can be performed.  
   * ***Offline***  - the database has not been used recently, and will become online upon access.  
   * ***Disabled*** - the database has been disabled.  
  
   * Note:  
     If the database is contained in a cluster's node that is different than the node that is currently viewed in this Studio instance, then 'Remote' will be indicated - see more [below](../../studio/database/databases-list-view.mdx#remote-database).

2. **Containing nodes**   
   These are the nodes that contain a copy of the database. 

3. **Database size**    
   The total size of the database, including both documents and indexes.

4. **Up time**        
   The time that has passed since database last came online. 

5. **Number of documents**      
   The number of documents in the database.

6. **Latest backup time**      
   The time of the latest database backup.
      
7. **Number of indexes**    
   The number of index errors will show if relevant.

8. **Alerts**    
   The number of alerts on this database if there are any.

9. **Performance hints**    
   The number of performance hints on this database if there are any.
   


## Database Actions

![Figure 2. Database Actions](./assets/database-actions-1.png)

1. **Create new database**  
   A new database can be created from scratch, from a backup copy, or from existing 3.x data - see more [below](../../studio/database/databases-list-view.mdx#creating-new-database-options).

2. **Manage group**  
   Click to manage the nodes that contain this database - see more about [The Database Group](../../studio/database/settings/manage-database-group.mdx).

3. **Disable/Enable the database**  
   A disabled database cannot be accessed. 

4. **More actions**  
   Pause indexing, Disable indexing, Compact database - see more [below](../../studio/database/databases-list-view.mdx#more-actions). 

5. **Refresh data**  
   Refresh the database stats data in this view from the server.

6. **Delete the database**  


## Creating New Database Options

![Figure 3. Creating New Database](./assets/database-actions-2.png)

1. **Create new database from scratch**   
   See detailed flow [here](../../studio/database/create-new-database/general-flow.mdx)  

2. **Create new database from an existing backup copy**   
   See detailed flow [here](../../studio/database/create-new-database/from-backup.mdx)  

3. **Create new database from legacy data files**      
   Create a new database from a 3.x RavenDB version database    
   See detailed flow [here](../../studio/database/create-new-database/from-legacy-files.mdx)


## More Actions

![Figure 4. More Actions](./assets/database-actions-3.png)

1. **Pause indexing**      
   All indexes on this database will pause indexing.  
   Indexing will be paused only on the __local node__ the browser is opened on.  
   Indexing will __resume__ with either of the following:  
     * Click this button again ("Resume indexing")  
     * Restart the server.  
     * Reload the database (by disabling and then enabling the database state).  
     * Resume indexing from the client code. See [resume indexing](../../client-api/operations/maintenance/indexes/start-indexing.mdx).  

2. **Disable indexing**     
   * Click 'Disable indexing' to disable all indexes on this database, on all nodes.  
   * After clicking, __for the change to be in effect__, the database must be re-loaded by either:  
      * Restart the server, or  
      * Disable/enable the database  
   * Indexing will remain __disabled__ after restarting the server or after disabling/enabling the database.  
   * To __enable__ indexing back click this button again ("Enable indexing").  
     And again, the database must be reloaded for the change to be in effect.  

3. **Compact database**   
   Physically compact the database on disk.  


## Remote Database

![Figure 5. Remote Database](./assets/database-actions-4.png)

* If the database is contained in one of the cluster's other nodes, but not in the node you are currently viewing in this instance of the studio,  
  the database state will be ***'Remote'***

* For example, in the above figure, DB2 is contained in nodes A & B. 
  DB2 is labeled ***'Remote'*** because we are currently viewing node C.  

* **Note:** Clicking on a remote database will navigate to the documents view for this database on one of its containing nodes.
