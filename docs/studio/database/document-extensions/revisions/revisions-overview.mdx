# Viewing Document Revisions
<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

* **Document Revisions** are snapshots of documents that can be created manually or automatically when a document is created, modified, or deleted.
  Revisions can be used for data auditing, instant restoration after document corruption, and other purposes.

* Learn more about document revisions in this [document revisions overview](../../../../document-extensions/revisions/overview.mdx):  
  * To define and enable revisions creation, see [revisions configuration](../../../../document-extensions/revisions/overview.mdx#revisions-configuration).  
  * A dynamic walkthrough demonstrating revisions management is available [here](../../../../document-extensions/revisions/overview.mdx#how-it-works).  

* This article provides an overview of how to view and compare revisions of a specific document.  
  * To see all revisions in the database, go to the [All Revisions](../../../../studio/database/document-extensions/revisions/all-revisions.mdx) view.  
  * To access revisions of deleted documents, go to the [Revisions Bin](../../../../studio/database/document-extensions/revisions/revisions-bin.mdx) view.    
* In this page:
  * [Revisions tab](../../../../studio/database/document-extensions/revisions/revisions.mdx#revisions-tab)  
  * [Revision inspection](../../../../studio/database/document-extensions/revisions/revisions.mdx#revision-inspection)  
  * [Revisions comparison](../../../../studio/database/document-extensions/revisions/revisions.mdx#revisions-comparison)  

</Admonition>
## Revisions tab

* Located within the Document View,  
  the Revisions Tab displays the full trail of all revisions created for the document.
* From this tab, you can inspect each revision, manually force the creation of a new revision,  
  and compare revisions to the live document version and to other revisions.

4. **Clone**

   * You can then save the clone under a new name to create a new document.  
   * Saving the clone with the exact same ID as the revision's parent document will revert the document to this revision.
