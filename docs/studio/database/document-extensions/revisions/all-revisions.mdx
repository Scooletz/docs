# The All Revisions View
<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

**Displaying revisions**:  

* The **All Revisions** view displays all [revisions](../../../../studio/database/document-extensions/revisions/revisions-overview.mdx) created over time for all your documents in the database.  
  This is a Studio-only feature; there is no Client API method to retrieve all revisions from the server.
  
* You can view all existing revisions or filter them by their **Collection** or **Type**.  
  Revision types:   
  * **"Regular Revision"** - A revision that is created when the document is created or modified.
  * **"Delete Revision"** - A revision that is created when the document is deleted.
**Deleting revisions**:  

* From this view, you can manually delete selected revisions ("Regular Revisions" only).  
  Other available deletion methods are summarized in [All ways to delete revisions](../../../../studio/database/document-extensions/revisions/all-revisions.mdx#all-ways-to-delete-revisions).

* Removing revisions from a secure server requires a client certificate with an
  [Admin](../../../../server/security/authorization/security-clearance-and-permissions.mdx#section) or higher security clearance.

     <Admonition type="warning" title="Warning">
     * Exercise caution when deleting revisions, as this is a permanent action and cannot be undone.  
       Once a revision is removed, it will no longer be available and will Not be listed in this view.
