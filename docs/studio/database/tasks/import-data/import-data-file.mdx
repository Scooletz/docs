# Import data from .ravendbdump file
<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

* `.ravendbdump` is RavenDB's format for [exportation of data](../export-database) 
  into and from files.  

* RavenDB dump files can be used to easily migrate data from one database 
  to another.  They are commonly used when the database is upgraded.  

* an exported `.ravendbdump` file can be used to migrate the data stored 
  in a non-sharded database into a sharded database.  
  Learn more about this operation in the [section dedicated to it](../../../../sharding/import-and-export#import).

## Import data to destination server from file
  
If you have already [exported a database](../export-database), follow these steps in the studio when you're ready to import from file.  

![Figure 1. Importing Database From File ](./assets/studio-view-import-fromfile-steps.png)

1. **Tasks**  
   In the destination server, click Tasks tab.  
2. **Import Data**.  
   Click to see various impoprt options.  
3. **From file (.ravendbdump)**  
   Seclect to import from a source database which has previously been [exported](../export-database).  
4. **Warning**  
   *Make sure that you are not writing over data that you want to keep*.  
   One option is [to start a new database with the studio](https://ravendb.net/docs/article-page/5.2/csharp/studio/database/create-new-database/general-flow).  
5. **Select file**  
   Select the `.ravendbdump` file that you previously exported from the source server.  
6. **Documents and Extensions**  
  Select desired [options](../../tasks/import-data/import-data-file#import-options).  
  *If you encrypted while exporting* make sure to select **imported file is encrypted**.  
  You will need to paste the encryption key that you saved when creating the encrypted database.  
7. **Advanced**  
   Click to configure [advanced import options]  
8. **Import Database**  
   Click after configuring the new database to finalize the import task.

3. [Imported file is encrypted](../../../../server/security/overview#encryption)  
 Toggle to include the decryption key when importing data from encrypted file.  
 Make sure that **Encrypt exported file** option was selected when exporting from source database so that the encryption key is included.

## Advanced import options

Click the **Advanced** button at the bottom of the options view for the following import features.

### Transform Script

In the Studio, select **database** &gt; click **Task** tab &gt; select **Import** &gt; select **From file (.ravendbdump)** &gt; click the **Advanced** button at the bottom &gt; toggle **Use Transform script**.  

![Figure 3. Advanced Import Options - Transform Script](./assets/import-from-file-advanced-transform-script.png)

- **Use Transform Script**  
  Enabling this **advanced** option allows you to provide a transform javascript, that would operate on each document imported from the file.  

  Sample transform javascript:  

<TabItem value="something" label="javascript">
<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`delete this['@metadata']['@change-vector']
// The script above will delete the change-vector from imported documents
// and will generate new change vectors during import. 
// This is very helpfull if the data is imported from a diffrent database group
// and you want to avoid adding old change vector entries to a new environment. 
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
### Customize Configuration and Ongoing Tasks

This **advanced** option enables you to choose whether to import various ongoing tasks, connection strings and advanced configurations.

In the Studio, select **database** &gt; click **Task** tab &gt; select **Import** &gt; select **From file (.ravendbdump)** &gt; click the **Advanced** button at the bottom &gt; toggle **Customize configuration and Ongoing Tasks**.  

![Figure 4. Advanced Import Options - Customize Configuration and Ongoing Tasks](./assets/import-from-file-advanced-configuration-ongoing-tasks.png)

Toggle to include the following configurations and ongoing tasks.  
If a task is included but doesn't exist in your source database, it will be skipped.  

**Ongoing tasks:**

- [Periodic Backups](../../../../studio/database/tasks/backup-task)  
- [External replications](../../../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/external-replication-task)  
- [ETL Tasks - Extract, Transform, Load](../../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/basics)  
- [Pull Replication Sinks](../../../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/hub-sink-replication/overview)  
- [Pull Replication Hubs](../../../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/hub-sink-replication/overview)  

**Other:**

- [Settings](../../../../studio/database/settings/database-settings)
