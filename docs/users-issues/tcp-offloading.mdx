#TCP Offloading

## Symptoms

- An exception is thrown in RavenDB Client when accessing RavenDB Server, because of a socket timeout
- A general slow operation of client system

## Cause

It appears that the machine hosting the RavenDB Server had the TCP offload functionality enabled, which seems to be causing connection drops, a problem experienced also by other applications like SQL Server.

## Resolution

Disable TCP Offloading.
