## Overview

*Microsoft Azure Cloud Account* created this way has a few differences in comparison to the regular *Cloud Account*:

- Monthly invoices are issued by *Microsoft Azure*, not by *RavenDB Cloud*.

- Billing and contact information are fully managed by *Microsoft Azure*. Changing the parameters is not possible via Cloud Portal.
