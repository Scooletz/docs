## The Account Tab

!["Account Tab"](./assets/portal-account-tab.png)  

* 
   **A**. The **Account** tab lets you view and edit your **Invoice** and **Payment** information.  
   **B**. Information you add/edit here appears on the payment invoices we provide you, normally at the end of the month.  
   **C**. Add/Edit payment methods here. The first we try to charge is always the one you choose as 
      [Active](../../cloud/cloud-pricing-payment-billing#credit-card).  
   **D**. Should charging the active payment method fail, we'll continue trying through your list.
