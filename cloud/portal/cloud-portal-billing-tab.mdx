* **Costs**  
  Sums up your current expenses over your products.  
* **Past Invoices**  
  Collects your invoices up to date.  
* **Contracts**  
  Shows what remains of services you pre-paid for, e.g. the 10 months left of a yearly contract you've started two months ago.  
* **Pay Now**  
  The `Pay Now` button is designed to facilitate immediate payment of outstanding costs accrued from previous billing
  cycles. This feature is especially useful for ensuring timely payments and maintaining up-to-date account status.
  It can be used when automatic charge fails due to reasons like expired cards or insufficient funds.
  You can read more about the _Pay Now_ option on the [Pricing, Payment and Billing](../cloud-pricing-payment-billing#pay-now) page.
